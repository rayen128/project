# Breadboard

Breadboards allow us to quickly assemble electronic circuits without doing any soldering. Great for testing and learning!

We can simply plug our components in the holes of our breadboard. The holes have internal wiring which allows us to connect different components to each other.

## Types of breadboards.

Breadboards come in different sizes with different internal wiring. The image below shows the wiring of three of the most common breadboards.
