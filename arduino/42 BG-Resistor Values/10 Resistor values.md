# Resistor values

Resistors can have different values. The higher the resistance, the less current will flow through it. The value of a resistor is expressed in Ohm (Ω). Resistors are color coded to indicate their particular resistance.

The following chart shows how to interpret the color coding of a resistor:

## Applications:

### LED

A LED requires a resistance (connected in series) to prevent too much current going through it. If you don't do this, you'll likely blow up the LED. Typical resistances for a LED are in the range 100Ω - 2kΩ. The higher the resistance, the lower the intensity of the emitted light.

### Pull-up

Typical resistances for a pull-up are in the range 10kΩ - 10MΩ. A higher resistance wastes less energy, but can also be less reliable.
