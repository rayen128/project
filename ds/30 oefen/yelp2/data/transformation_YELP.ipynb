It was a long wait to get seated, but our server was very attentive and the food was great! We loved the truffle fries and the gnocchi was fantastic as well. However, when we returned with a friend, our server was a little more on the apathetic side. We had to get up three times and she was constantly forgetting things. The food was still excellent, but I wouldn't say that about the service. I know being on Capitol Hill, it's kind of expected, but there have been other times when we have gone in there and our server was fantastic. Our last experience, was not a great one though. We sat for fifteen minutes without ever being acknowledged. Now, to be fair, there were some very large parties, but as we sat around, we noticed that there were other people who had been there for a while before us and still had not been served their drinks. We actually watched two other parties leave without ordering, which we soon did after. The bartender was a little less than helpful when my boyfriend went up and asked if they had the swordfish (which unfortunately they are always out of when we go). Now, I'm no expert on running a restaurant, but I really do think they could have more than one person serving and a bartender on staff at the same time. I am a big service person and I have found it to be disappointing more times than not. However, we have learned that if we aren't in a big rush and really don't mind waiting then it is a good choice. But, if you're hungry and are looking to be served right away, it's best to go early. We'll go back again, I'm sure, because the food is so great, but I really think there are some bugs they need to work out in the flow of running their restaurant.\"}, {'review_id': 'lxJAxnf2LKq0IFLjhcXqug', 'business_id': '1jyenjdG7kw6i1NEDLr1ZA', 'user_id': 'EBp9PfvQi3dOglIZ6UllRQ', 'date': '2012-02-19', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"I went here for a sunday brunch and I was pleasantly surprised!

I'm easily sold by the restaurant's recommendations so that was that.They also had several mimosa options which was great!

I'm always weary of bad reviews because I feel like some people are natural complainers. This place was just BAD! Please read on..I went with a friend to have a nice brunch. It was noon and we walked into 22 Doors because it was recommended by friends. I know this place has a nightlife too, so this critique is just based on their brunch service..There were only 2 or 3 people I could identify as employees and the place was packed with tables where people were finished eating and waiting for checks. Just as we walked in some people got up and left what was to be the only free table at the time. Instead of waiting ages for someone to bus it, we sat down and patiently waited at a dirty table. The servers seemed to do that intentional avoiding-eye contact-thing so they didn't have to help us for 15 minutes or so.After ordering drinks and food I was saddened to learn that they only had one teabag of English Breakfast tea left in the whole joint. After tossing a coin my friend was the one who had to have a cup of Earl Grey instead. (muahaha). Then we ordered our food. It arrived in good time (although the people behind us arrived after we did and got their food first.)I poured my hot water into the tea mug and it wasn't hot at all. It also had some weird shredded paper in it. It looked like toilet paper but I'm assuming it was something less vile like shredded paper towel. Still gross. I actually took a sip of the tea before noticing and nearly lost my appetite before the food was served. Upon looking at the menu the prices seemed comparable to other brunch hotspots but the sides are ridiculously priced. I had the Corned Beef Hash (it was meh..) Literally though, there was a hair in it. Which I also didn't notice until I was half way through the dish. At this point I was totally over this place. My friend had the crab cake eggs benedict. I really hate when people sell food that's frozen. Why would I pay someone to heat up something I could buy at safeway for cheaper and heat up myself? I eat out to eat fresh food. So needless to say the crab cakes are pre-made and frozen and weren't very good at all.Then there was the side of sausage. The side of sausage cost $4 but it only contained 3 slices of sausage. By slices I mean, 1 whole sausage cut down the middle and then another half. So $4 for 1 and a half sausages. WTF! So each whole sausage piece is worth $2.66?? WOWZA. For that price I'd also have expected it not to be pre-frozen or available from safeway. It just feels like cheating.I think that's it .. hair in the food, bad service in general, food was just alright but sides are over-priced and the water for my tea had shreds of soggy paper in it. I'm sure this terrible service was atypical but I don't feel like giving this place a second chance to see if they deserve another star or not.\"}, {'review_id': 'IcTdrIf7hmhu-Lrbt2RNtA', 'business_id': '1jyenjdG7kw6i1NEDLr1ZA', 'user_id': 'klV8OmU4eK_oPI98oalfPg', 'date': '2007-06-19', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': 'I\\'ve been here for drinks a couple of times and there\\'s a reason I keep going back.The Spanish 43 is my new crush.

But for now, the review of 22 Doors, the lucky establishment where we rocked the house.Someone really should call ahead to these places and let them know when a ton of us are descending upon them like the Greek Gods and Goddesses we are. ;) The service seemed spotty and disorganized at first, with at least the female server/bartender wearing a \"Holy Hell Get Me Outta Here, I didn\\'t sign on for this on a Sunday Night\" look. But once a few of us cleared out and the big private party in the back left, things improved considerably. So basically, I\\'m calling it 50/50 - partially our gargantuan party threw them off their game.Bartender John is exactly how I like my bartenders. Attractive, sexy, complimentary, flirtatious, and cool under pressure. His compliments didn\\'t seem fake at all or a ploy for bigger tips. That is a very critical skill to cultivate if you\\'re in the service industry - novices, please take note.Had a super long day and forgot I was on the hill, so opted for a coffee with Bailey\\'s to perk me up. Drink was exactly how I\\'d requested (about half a shot of booze), and the price really did the job: $8. Note to self: next time have tea at home and grab a pint instead. They were out of Hoegaarden so I opted for a pint of the Moose Drool. I liked the \"cozy up to the bar\" vibe perpetuated by the decor and comfortable bar stools/chairs plus hooks for your purse/jacket, etc. This review is 3 stars because I didn\\'t partake of the food, and didn\\'t want to inflate the review of the establishment based on how great a time I had with everyone. But I\\'ll definitely be back to hang out and get a better feel for the place.Street parking: Forget it. This is Cap Hill! I\\'d recommend parking a few blocks away and hoofing it, or catching a cab.

Now drum rolls, and ready, set go! for a couple of delightful weeks of gastronomical tour with my lovely Ryan!After picking me up at the airport and running a couple of errands, we brought our growling stomachs to 22 Doors for brunch. So this review will be based exclusively on the brunch experience. We didn\\'t have to wait and sat ourselves promptly. Knowing they have a pretty impressive and popular liquor/wine/fancy drinks list, but not in the mood for something too strong, I ordered a Mimosa to pair up with my brunch. It was delicious! Made with freshly squeezed orange juice, it was tasty, fresh and perfectly bubbly. Welcome to Seattle, Valentina!I ordered the Eggs Benedict and had to go with the muffins, because the were sold out of crab cakes (Crab Cakes EB, original offer in the menu). Taking into account that we got there at 2:15 PM (brunch is Sat-Sun between 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM) I wasn\\'t that disappointed. I though \"well, maybe a little less calories\" and told our waitress to go ahead and bring me those good \\'ol muffins. Ryan ordered a burger, with the aioli in the side. Both dishes were solid. Ryan loved his burger, and told me it was perfectly cooked (medium rare). He didn\\'t like the aioli but lucky me, I used it to drown the potatoes that came with my eggs, which were pretty good. The Hollandeise sauce stood up to the rest of the ingredients, thought. It was creamy and light, yet tasty. The poached eggs were well cooked, not to &#160;hard, not to liquidy. Service was good and laid-back, a little slow but very Sunday-like. We didn\\'t have a problem with that as we were there to enjoy with no rush. We also liked the ambiance (lush, interesting decor) and loved the music they were playing, something between Wax Poetic and 70s soft, semi-erotica-esque soul...fantastic!We will definitely go back to check it out for appetizers and cocktails. Now, and after reading my fellow Seattle Yelpers\\' reviews, I can\\'t take the truffle french fries out of my mind!Update: We went back last night for a nite cap, and loved it!

They use high quality ingredients (like South American cinnamon picked by blind nuns who live in huts teetering on the cliffs of the Andes mountain range), and they charge accordingly. This is the spot that you stop at for those first couple of drinks, and then move on to cheaper pastures as your tastes buds are dulled by the booze buzz.The atmos here is classy and mysterious. A nice date spot (for when you take me out with your goldcard!). Though, if you're single, the clientele and the wait staff aren't hard to look at.\"}, {'review_id': 'v51afX7RfZ6FpZtBG_ohuQ', 'business_id': '1jyenjdG7kw6i1NEDLr1ZA', 'user_id': 'Zx9Y8WPHvnoqWKm0eP5xSg', 'date': '2008-06-23', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"My New Favorite Brunch Spot..I had the best brunch here last week- ok, I admit we tried to get into Crave first and it was packed...

But the food and drinks were lacking. I had the pineapple basted tempura with jasmine rice and veggies. The rice was awful, it was half cooked and while it looked pretty on the plate, it tasted horrid. The veggies were ok. I'm not big on the squash, but they were edible. The chicken was just wrong. Safeway makes a line of Asian dishes that are far more appealing than here. It had flavor I guess, but it was not worth the money. Maybe I should have tried the burger, but if you're going to charge 15 bucks for a dish, it should taste better. And while the cocktail I got was pretty, it was mediocre at best.

In my experience the party has always been on the patio so don\\'t get turned off by the first impression.The mullet-style business in the front party in the back setting lends to the sensation that one has been invited to a dignified gathering. The host just happens to be a skilled mixologist and talented chef. Delicate flavors are devoured in the company of sophisticated bevvies. The rosemary and truffle oil fries are nothing short of divine, like the service. The staff are personable, friendly, and attentive, a welcome reprieve from the usual nonsense.One day I will try the brunch. In the meantime, I have to remember to recommend this place to people looking for a place to drink and dine with their stylish friends.'}, {'review_id': 'l_n5_VIST-87q3TWJvX1Jg', 'business_id': '1jyenjdG7kw6i1NEDLr1ZA', 'user_id': 'Uv3reHuWFxs5bgiDFGkFVQ', 'date': '2009-09-20', 'stars': 2.0, 'text': 'After visiting The Doors post-remodel, formerly one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle, I have to amend my rating. &#160;Formerly called 22 doors because, well, 22 funky, dark wood doors were incorporated into the decor, I\\'m wondering when they\\'ll make a name change since these doors were no where to be seen in the re-modeled version. Instead of cozy deep reds, three rows of wide cushy booths and art-lined walls, we walked in to find hard wood booths against the walls (leaving a gaping hole in the middle of the restaurant... dance floor we wondered?), bare walls and all the lovely character/coziness that we knew and loved... GONE. Apparently, our watering hole has a new owner? Now the menu.... luckily, the veggie burger is still on the menu (didn\\'t try it but I would assume it\\'s the same). But every other dish besides the 22 Doors burger has been replaced by eats labeled \"small\" and \"bigger\", sort of a tapas feel. Gone is the grilled cheese, incredible Caesar salad, or any dish that you don\\'t need to order at least two of to make a meal.

In general, I don't like places that are lit so dim that I can't see how my food is prepared and that members of my dinner party need to steal the LED candle on our table to find a fallen credit card, but I suppose some things must be sacrified for the ambience. To me, 22 Doors was another place on the Hill like many others that can't seem to decide what they want to be or who they want to serve. Staffed by hipsters sporting plaid shirts who had to yell at each other to be heard over the odd soundtrack of Flaming Lips interspersed with salsa and jazz, 22 Doors is sort of a mix between your neighborhood bar, coffee shop, and eatery. The clientele was equally an equally schizophrenic blend of young frat/sorority types, yuppies like us and everybody's parents. Oh, and how could I forget the odd chandeliers shaped like tasseled boobs that looked like they belonged more in a Mariott or Radisson circa 1994?I can forgive a restaurant undergoing identity crisis mode when they have good service and food, which 22 Doors has plenty of. As Dana W. mentioned, the Azul Arepa was delicious. The menu described it as shredded pork with some kind of cheese topped with caramelized figs all on a flour tortilla, and let me tell you, it was like biting into Heaven. The ravioli was decent but nothing to write home about, and while the truffle fries were good value and addictive, I thought they just tasted like regular fries, if damned good ones. I tried some of my friend's tortilla, which turned out to be the tapas dish Tortilla de Patatas, my favorite. 22 Doors's rendition was disappointing, topped with some kind of weird unmentionable sauce.I, like Dana W., was perturbed by the wall length mirror placed just so in the bathroom: once you catch a glimpse of yourself on the toilet, you just can't look away.Bottom line: good place for a group, bad place for a date (unless you don't want to hear them).

However, I never was lucky enough to see it...until last week. I exited Crossfit SLU in the alley at the end of lunch time and there it was gleaming in the sunlight! No line in front, it beckoned me with its shiny black exterior and clean silver counters. Hello Panda boxes winked at me, I'm sure of it. Clouds parted, angels sang..all of that. When I get on a food kick it can last an awful long time. Lately I've been eating vermicelli bowls like nobody's business. They had one left, it was a tofu vermicelli bowl. I reached deep in to my pockets only to realize that all I had was a roll of quarters. I left my debit card at home! Oh noes! So what do I do? Do I embarrass myself and pay in ALL quarters or simply try to catch this unicorn of a food truck another time? I paid $6 in quarters, they didn't mind. I smile at the ladies in the truck and told them that I had once messaged them about a suggestion I had to wrap their banh mi sandwiches in lettuce, making them a little bit closer to Paleo for the legions of Crossfit fans that would flock to this truck. She remembered my message. I was impressed. They were so polite and eager to talk about their food with me. While we sat there and chatted for a bit about food, I got all glassy eyed at the incredible Asian candy/snack counter they had! Amazing! The vermicelli bowl was fantastic. I loved it and I can't wait to try the lemongrass chicken bowl. &#160;Also..can't wait to try their banh mi's! HUGE fan of the food, even bigger fan of the service!

Social Media - I have to say that one of the things I love about this truck and the owners is how they use social media. Long before Xplosive hit the road, there was buzz on the typical outlets like Facebook and Twitter. Before I went to the truck, I had not seen a menu, and I knew I wanted to try the food. I loved getting updates on how the truck was coming along, seeing the beautiful paint job, and even seeing it being stocked for the first week in action. Food Quality - The food was very good. I questioned the menu choices at the Rodeo but it's hard to know what people are going to want (especially with 45+ trucks). Those of us who attend food truck gatherings can't necessarily carbo-load on a foot long bahn mi since we want to eat at other trucks as well. However, it was difficult to argue with the well-marinated meat, crisp, fresh veggies, and crusty bread. The tacos were very good and Xplosive offered a trio of them, which I thought was a great idea and much smaller portion than the bahn mi. A friend of mine (not a tofu eater) said that was the best tofu he had ever tasted and he is now a believer. The fact that the truck has goodies like Yan Yan and Pineapple flavored marshmallows is a bonus. I feel like I'm a kid again in a small town in Hawaii with my few dollars getting ready to buy a treat. It's a nice touch that I appreciate and I'm sure others do as well. I am so happy that I can find the truck at South Lake Union (starting this week). I was worried that the route would keep me away from all the goodness that is Xplosive.Customer Service - The staff is really, really friendly. At the Rodeo, there was more than enough staff (something that newer trucks may overlook). They had at least 3 people outside the truck and I believe 3-4 people inside the truck. When there were slow periods, staff walked the streets handing out high quality postcards advertising the truck. It's that kind of attitude that will bring the customers in.I'm looking forward to seeing Xplosive often. I think they're off to a great start and have the qualities that will build them a solid fan base.\"}, {'review_id': 'Wu5az6Bl0INUp5OEFintXw', 'business_id': '0iyzWPc4C58sAJUAAE-BIg', 'user_id': '6Y1vjj8j6eZIbIZh_1HeYQ', 'date': '2012-11-10', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': 'This place tries to copy the Marination Mobile menu. &#160;How unoriginal and disgusting!

However, I never was lucky enough to see it...until last week. I exited Crossfit SLU in the alley at the end of lunch time and there it was gleaming in the sunlight! No line in front, it beckoned me with its shiny black exterior and clean silver counters. Hello Panda boxes winked at me, I'm sure of it. Clouds parted, angels sang..all of that. When I get on a food kick it can last an awful long time. Lately I've been eating vermicelli bowls like nobody's business. They had one left, it was a tofu vermicelli bowl. I reached deep in to my pockets only to realize that all I had was a roll of quarters. I left my debit card at home! Oh noes! So what do I do? Do I embarrass myself and pay in ALL quarters or simply try to catch this unicorn of a food truck another time? I paid $6 in quarters, they didn't mind. I smile at the ladies in the truck and told them that I had once messaged them about a suggestion I had to wrap their banh mi sandwiches in lettuce, making them a little bit closer to Paleo for the legions of Crossfit fans that would flock to this truck. She remembered my message. I was impressed. They were so polite and eager to talk about their food with me. While we sat there and chatted for a bit about food, I got all glassy eyed at the incredible Asian candy/snack counter they had! Amazing! The vermicelli bowl was fantastic. I loved it and I can't wait to try the lemongrass chicken bowl. &#160;Also..can't wait to try their banh mi's! HUGE fan of the food, even bigger fan of the service! If you ever have a hankering for Filipino or Vietnamese food, follow their FB or their Twitter to see where they'll be parked. I may end up stalking these folks at least once a week...or until they get a restaurant.

Social Media - I have to say that one of the things I love about this truck and the owners is how they use social media. Long before Xplosive hit the road, there was buzz on the typical outlets like Facebook and Twitter. Before I went to the truck, I had not seen a menu, and I knew I wanted to try the food. I loved getting updates on how the truck was coming along, seeing the beautiful paint job, and even seeing it being stocked for the first week in action. Food Quality - The food was very good. I questioned the menu choices at the Rodeo but it's hard to know what people are going to want (especially with 45+ trucks). Those of us who attend food truck gatherings can't necessarily carbo-load on a foot long bahn mi since we want to eat at other trucks as well. However, it was difficult to argue with the well-marinated meat, crisp, fresh veggies, and crusty bread. The tacos were very good and Xplosive offered a trio of them, which I thought was a great idea and much smaller portion than the bahn mi. A friend of mine (not a tofu eater) said that was the best tofu he had ever tasted and he is now a believer. The fact that the truck has goodies like Yan Yan and Pineapple flavored marshmallows is a bonus. I feel like I'm a kid again in a small town in Hawaii with my few dollars getting ready to buy a treat. It's a nice touch that I appreciate and I'm sure others do as well. I am so happy that I can find the truck at South Lake Union (starting this week). I was worried that the route would keep me away from all the goodness that is Xplosive.Customer Service - The staff is really, really friendly. At the Rodeo, there was more than enough staff (something that newer trucks may overlook). They had at least 3 people outside the truck and I believe 3-4 people inside the truck. When there were slow periods, staff walked the streets handing out high quality postcards advertising the truck. It's that kind of attitude that will bring the customers in.I'm looking forward to seeing Xplosive often. I think they're off to a great start and have the qualities that will build them a solid fan base.\"}, {'review_id': 'Wu5az6Bl0INUp5OEFintXw', 'business_id': '0iyzWPc4C58sAJUAAE-BIg', 'user_id': '6Y1vjj8j6eZIbIZh_1HeYQ', 'date': '2012-11-10', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': 'This place tries to copy the Marination Mobile menu. &#160;How unoriginal and disgusting!

However, I never was lucky enough to see it...until last week. I exited Crossfit SLU in the alley at the end of lunch time and there it was gleaming in the sunlight! No line in front, it beckoned me with its shiny black exterior and clean silver counters. Hello Panda boxes winked at me, I'm sure of it. Clouds parted, angels sang..all of that. When I get on a food kick it can last an awful long time. Lately I've been eating vermicelli bowls like nobody's business. They had one left, it was a tofu vermicelli bowl. I reached deep in to my pockets only to realize that all I had was a roll of quarters. I left my debit card at home! Oh noes! So what do I do? Do I embarrass myself and pay in ALL quarters or simply try to catch this unicorn of a food truck another time? I paid $6 in quarters, they didn't mind. I smile at the ladies in the truck and told them that I had once messaged them about a suggestion I had to wrap their banh mi sandwiches in lettuce, making them a little bit closer to Paleo for the legions of Crossfit fans that would flock to this truck. She remembered my message. I was impressed. They were so polite and eager to talk about their food with me. While we sat there and chatted for a bit about food, I got all glassy eyed at the incredible Asian candy/snack counter they had! Amazing! The vermicelli bowl was fantastic. I loved it and I can't wait to try the lemongrass chicken bowl. &#160;Also..can't wait to try their banh mi's! HUGE fan of the food, even bigger fan of the service!

Social Media - I have to say that one of the things I love about this truck and the owners is how they use social media. Long before Xplosive hit the road, there was buzz on the typical outlets like Facebook and Twitter. Before I went to the truck, I had not seen a menu, and I knew I wanted to try the food. I loved getting updates on how the truck was coming along, seeing the beautiful paint job, and even seeing it being stocked for the first week in action. Food Quality - The food was very good. I questioned the menu choices at the Rodeo but it's hard to know what people are going to want (especially with 45+ trucks). Those of us who attend food truck gatherings can't necessarily carbo-load on a foot long bahn mi since we want to eat at other trucks as well. However, it was difficult to argue with the well-marinated meat, crisp, fresh veggies, and crusty bread. The tacos were very good and Xplosive offered a trio of them, which I thought was a great idea and much smaller portion than the bahn mi. A friend of mine (not a tofu eater) said that was the best tofu he had ever tasted and he is now a believer. The fact that the truck has goodies like Yan Yan and Pineapple flavored marshmallows is a bonus. I feel like I'm a kid again in a small town in Hawaii with my few dollars getting ready to buy a treat. It's a nice touch that I appreciate and I'm sure others do as well. I am so happy that I can find the truck at South Lake Union (starting this week). I was worried that the route would keep me away from all the goodness that is Xplosive.Customer Service - The staff is really, really friendly. At the Rodeo, there was more than enough staff (something that newer trucks may overlook). They had at least 3 people outside the truck and I believe 3-4 people inside the truck. When there were slow periods, staff walked the streets handing out high quality postcards advertising the truck. It's that kind of attitude that will bring the customers in.I'm looking forward to seeing Xplosive often. I think they're off to a great start and have the qualities that will build them a solid fan base.\"}, {'review_id': 'Wu5az6Bl0INUp5OEFintXw', 'business_id': '0iyzWPc4C58sAJUAAE-BIg', 'user_id': '6Y1vjj8j6eZIbIZh_1HeYQ', 'date': '2012-11-10', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': 'This place tries to copy the Marination Mobile menu. &#160;How unoriginal and disgusting!
