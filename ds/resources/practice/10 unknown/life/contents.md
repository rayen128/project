# Visualizing life expectancy and fertility

## Research question

 "How did life expectancy and fertility change between 1964 - 2013 for different countries and continents?".

## Data

The data contains information about the average life expectancy and total fertility (number of children per woman) per capita of 244 countries from 1964 - 2013.

## Description

Many medical and social advances have been made since the 60s and the goal of your visualization will be to show the effect of this in an informative way. More specifically, you would like to answer the following question: "How did life expectancy and fertility change between 1964 - 2013 for different countries and continents?".

One way to do this is by creating an interactive plot that is able to show how fertility is related to life expectancy for every country, for every year. With this visualization you can show in which countries people live long lives in small families, or in contrast, short lives in large families. In addition, you might also want to add elements like population size and regions in your visualization, or even find a world map to display the data on.

Some smaller research questions you might be able to answer with this visualization are:

* Did differences between countries become smaller or larger between years?
* Which regions developed most in this time period?
* Are there countries that experienced a decrease in life expectancy at some point in time? Can you explain why this happened?
