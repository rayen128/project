It was a long wait to get seated, but our server was very attentive and the food was great! We loved the truffle fries and the gnocchi was fantastic as well. However, when we returned with a friend, our server was a little more on the apathetic side. We had to get up three times and she was constantly forgetting things. The food was still excellent, but I wouldn't say that about the service. I know being on Capitol Hill, it's kind of expected, but there have been other times when we have gone in there and our server was fantastic. Our last experience, was not a great one though. We sat for fifteen minutes without ever being acknowledged. Now, to be fair, there were some very large parties, but as we sat around, we noticed that there were other people who had been there for a while before us and still had not been served their drinks. We actually watched two other parties leave without ordering, which we soon did after. The bartender was a little less than helpful when my boyfriend went up and asked if they had the swordfish (which unfortunately they are always out of when we go). Now, I'm no expert on running a restaurant, but I really do think they could have more than one person serving and a bartender on staff at the same time. I am a big service person and I have found it to be disappointing more times than not. However, we have learned that if we aren't in a big rush and really don't mind waiting then it is a good choice. But, if you're hungry and are looking to be served right away, it's best to go early. We'll go back again, I'm sure, because the food is so great, but I really think there are some bugs they need to work out in the flow of running their restaurant.\"}, {'review_id': 'lxJAxnf2LKq0IFLjhcXqug', 'business_id': '1jyenjdG7kw6i1NEDLr1ZA', 'user_id': 'EBp9PfvQi3dOglIZ6UllRQ', 'date': '2012-02-19', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"I went here for a sunday brunch and I was pleasantly surprised!

I'm easily sold by the restaurant's recommendations so that was that.They also had several mimosa options which was great!

I'm always weary of bad reviews because I feel like some people are natural complainers. This place was just BAD! Please read on..I went with a friend to have a nice brunch. It was noon and we walked into 22 Doors because it was recommended by friends. I know this place has a nightlife too, so this critique is just based on their brunch service..There were only 2 or 3 people I could identify as employees and the place was packed with tables where people were finished eating and waiting for checks. Just as we walked in some people got up and left what was to be the only free table at the time. Instead of waiting ages for someone to bus it, we sat down and patiently waited at a dirty table. The servers seemed to do that intentional avoiding-eye contact-thing so they didn't have to help us for 15 minutes or so.After ordering drinks and food I was saddened to learn that they only had one teabag of English Breakfast tea left in the whole joint. After tossing a coin my friend was the one who had to have a cup of Earl Grey instead. (muahaha). Then we ordered our food. It arrived in good time (although the people behind us arrived after we did and got their food first.)I poured my hot water into the tea mug and it wasn't hot at all. It also had some weird shredded paper in it. It looked like toilet paper but I'm assuming it was something less vile like shredded paper towel. Still gross. I actually took a sip of the tea before noticing and nearly lost my appetite before the food was served. Upon looking at the menu the prices seemed comparable to other brunch hotspots but the sides are ridiculously priced. I had the Corned Beef Hash (it was meh..) Literally though, there was a hair in it. Which I also didn't notice until I was half way through the dish. At this point I was totally over this place. My friend had the crab cake eggs benedict. I really hate when people sell food that's frozen. Why would I pay someone to heat up something I could buy at safeway for cheaper and heat up myself? I eat out to eat fresh food. So needless to say the crab cakes are pre-made and frozen and weren't very good at all.Then there was the side of sausage. The side of sausage cost $4 but it only contained 3 slices of sausage. By slices I mean, 1 whole sausage cut down the middle and then another half. So $4 for 1 and a half sausages. WTF! So each whole sausage piece is worth $2.66?? WOWZA. For that price I'd also have expected it not to be pre-frozen or available from safeway. It just feels like cheating.I think that's it .. hair in the food, bad service in general, food was just alright but sides are over-priced and the water for my tea had shreds of soggy paper in it. I'm sure this terrible service was atypical but I don't feel like giving this place a second chance to see if they deserve another star or not.\"}, {'review_id': 'IcTdrIf7hmhu-Lrbt2RNtA', 'business_id': '1jyenjdG7kw6i1NEDLr1ZA', 'user_id': 'klV8OmU4eK_oPI98oalfPg', 'date': '2007-06-19', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': 'I\\'ve been here for drinks a couple of times and there\\'s a reason I keep going back.The Spanish 43 is my new crush.

But for now, the review of 22 Doors, the lucky establishment where we rocked the house.Someone really should call ahead to these places and let them know when a ton of us are descending upon them like the Greek Gods and Goddesses we are. ;) The service seemed spotty and disorganized at first, with at least the female server/bartender wearing a \"Holy Hell Get Me Outta Here, I didn\\'t sign on for this on a Sunday Night\" look. But once a few of us cleared out and the big private party in the back left, things improved considerably. So basically, I\\'m calling it 50/50 - partially our gargantuan party threw them off their game.Bartender John is exactly how I like my bartenders. Attractive, sexy, complimentary, flirtatious, and cool under pressure. His compliments didn\\'t seem fake at all or a ploy for bigger tips. That is a very critical skill to cultivate if you\\'re in the service industry - novices, please take note.Had a super long day and forgot I was on the hill, so opted for a coffee with Bailey\\'s to perk me up. Drink was exactly how I\\'d requested (about half a shot of booze), and the price really did the job: $8. Note to self: next time have tea at home and grab a pint instead. They were out of Hoegaarden so I opted for a pint of the Moose Drool. I liked the \"cozy up to the bar\" vibe perpetuated by the decor and comfortable bar stools/chairs plus hooks for your purse/jacket, etc. This review is 3 stars because I didn\\'t partake of the food, and didn\\'t want to inflate the review of the establishment based on how great a time I had with everyone. But I\\'ll definitely be back to hang out and get a better feel for the place.Street parking: Forget it. This is Cap Hill! I\\'d recommend parking a few blocks away and hoofing it, or catching a cab.

Now drum rolls, and ready, set go! for a couple of delightful weeks of gastronomical tour with my lovely Ryan!After picking me up at the airport and running a couple of errands, we brought our growling stomachs to 22 Doors for brunch. So this review will be based exclusively on the brunch experience. We didn\\'t have to wait and sat ourselves promptly. Knowing they have a pretty impressive and popular liquor/wine/fancy drinks list, but not in the mood for something too strong, I ordered a Mimosa to pair up with my brunch. It was delicious! Made with freshly squeezed orange juice, it was tasty, fresh and perfectly bubbly. Welcome to Seattle, Valentina!I ordered the Eggs Benedict and had to go with the muffins, because the were sold out of crab cakes (Crab Cakes EB, original offer in the menu). Taking into account that we got there at 2:15 PM (brunch is Sat-Sun between 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM) I wasn\\'t that disappointed. I though \"well, maybe a little less calories\" and told our waitress to go ahead and bring me those good \\'ol muffins. Ryan ordered a burger, with the aioli in the side. Both dishes were solid. Ryan loved his burger, and told me it was perfectly cooked (medium rare). He didn\\'t like the aioli but lucky me, I used it to drown the potatoes that came with my eggs, which were pretty good. The Hollandeise sauce stood up to the rest of the ingredients, thought. It was creamy and light, yet tasty. The poached eggs were well cooked, not to &#160;hard, not to liquidy. Service was good and laid-back, a little slow but very Sunday-like. We didn\\'t have a problem with that as we were there to enjoy with no rush. We also liked the ambiance (lush, interesting decor) and loved the music they were playing, something between Wax Poetic and 70s soft, semi-erotica-esque soul...fantastic!We will definitely go back to check it out for appetizers and cocktails. Now, and after reading my fellow Seattle Yelpers\\' reviews, I can\\'t take the truffle french fries out of my mind!Update: We went back last night for a nite cap, and loved it!

They use high quality ingredients (like South American cinnamon picked by blind nuns who live in huts teetering on the cliffs of the Andes mountain range), and they charge accordingly. This is the spot that you stop at for those first couple of drinks, and then move on to cheaper pastures as your tastes buds are dulled by the booze buzz.The atmos here is classy and mysterious. A nice date spot (for when you take me out with your goldcard!). Though, if you're single, the clientele and the wait staff aren't hard to look at.\"}, {'review_id': 'v51afX7RfZ6FpZtBG_ohuQ', 'business_id': '1jyenjdG7kw6i1NEDLr1ZA', 'user_id': 'Zx9Y8WPHvnoqWKm0eP5xSg', 'date': '2008-06-23', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"My New Favorite Brunch Spot..I had the best brunch here last week- ok, I admit we tried to get into Crave first and it was packed...

But the food and drinks were lacking. I had the pineapple basted tempura with jasmine rice and veggies. The rice was awful, it was half cooked and while it looked pretty on the plate, it tasted horrid. The veggies were ok. I'm not big on the squash, but they were edible. The chicken was just wrong. Safeway makes a line of Asian dishes that are far more appealing than here. It had flavor I guess, but it was not worth the money. Maybe I should have tried the burger, but if you're going to charge 15 bucks for a dish, it should taste better. And while the cocktail I got was pretty, it was mediocre at best.

In my experience the party has always been on the patio so don\\'t get turned off by the first impression.The mullet-style business in the front party in the back setting lends to the sensation that one has been invited to a dignified gathering. The host just happens to be a skilled mixologist and talented chef. Delicate flavors are devoured in the company of sophisticated bevvies. The rosemary and truffle oil fries are nothing short of divine, like the service. The staff are personable, friendly, and attentive, a welcome reprieve from the usual nonsense.One day I will try the brunch. In the meantime, I have to remember to recommend this place to people looking for a place to drink and dine with their stylish friends.'}, {'review_id': 'l_n5_VIST-87q3TWJvX1Jg', 'business_id': '1jyenjdG7kw6i1NEDLr1ZA', 'user_id': 'Uv3reHuWFxs5bgiDFGkFVQ', 'date': '2009-09-20', 'stars': 2.0, 'text': 'After visiting The Doors post-remodel, formerly one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle, I have to amend my rating. &#160;Formerly called 22 doors because, well, 22 funky, dark wood doors were incorporated into the decor, I\\'m wondering when they\\'ll make a name change since these doors were no where to be seen in the re-modeled version. Instead of cozy deep reds, three rows of wide cushy booths and art-lined walls, we walked in to find hard wood booths against the walls (leaving a gaping hole in the middle of the restaurant... dance floor we wondered?), bare walls and all the lovely character/coziness that we knew and loved... GONE. Apparently, our watering hole has a new owner? Now the menu.... luckily, the veggie burger is still on the menu (didn\\'t try it but I would assume it\\'s the same). But every other dish besides the 22 Doors burger has been replaced by eats labeled \"small\" and \"bigger\", sort of a tapas feel. Gone is the grilled cheese, incredible Caesar salad, or any dish that you don\\'t need to order at least two of to make a meal.

In general, I don't like places that are lit so dim that I can't see how my food is prepared and that members of my dinner party need to steal the LED candle on our table to find a fallen credit card, but I suppose some things must be sacrified for the ambience. To me, 22 Doors was another place on the Hill like many others that can't seem to decide what they want to be or who they want to serve. Staffed by hipsters sporting plaid shirts who had to yell at each other to be heard over the odd soundtrack of Flaming Lips interspersed with salsa and jazz, 22 Doors is sort of a mix between your neighborhood bar, coffee shop, and eatery. The clientele was equally an equally schizophrenic blend of young frat/sorority types, yuppies like us and everybody's parents. Oh, and how could I forget the odd chandeliers shaped like tasseled boobs that looked like they belonged more in a Mariott or Radisson circa 1994?I can forgive a restaurant undergoing identity crisis mode when they have good service and food, which 22 Doors has plenty of. As Dana W. mentioned, the Azul Arepa was delicious. The menu described it as shredded pork with some kind of cheese topped with caramelized figs all on a flour tortilla, and let me tell you, it was like biting into Heaven. The ravioli was decent but nothing to write home about, and while the truffle fries were good value and addictive, I thought they just tasted like regular fries, if damned good ones. I tried some of my friend's tortilla, which turned out to be the tapas dish Tortilla de Patatas, my favorite. 22 Doors's rendition was disappointing, topped with some kind of weird unmentionable sauce.I, like Dana W., was perturbed by the wall length mirror placed just so in the bathroom: once you catch a glimpse of yourself on the toilet, you just can't look away.Bottom line: good place for a group, bad place for a date (unless you don't want to hear them).

However, I never was lucky enough to see it...until last week. I exited Crossfit SLU in the alley at the end of lunch time and there it was gleaming in the sunlight! No line in front, it beckoned me with its shiny black exterior and clean silver counters. Hello Panda boxes winked at me, I'm sure of it. Clouds parted, angels sang..all of that. When I get on a food kick it can last an awful long time. Lately I've been eating vermicelli bowls like nobody's business. They had one left, it was a tofu vermicelli bowl. I reached deep in to my pockets only to realize that all I had was a roll of quarters. I left my debit card at home! Oh noes! So what do I do? Do I embarrass myself and pay in ALL quarters or simply try to catch this unicorn of a food truck another time? I paid $6 in quarters, they didn't mind. I smile at the ladies in the truck and told them that I had once messaged them about a suggestion I had to wrap their banh mi sandwiches in lettuce, making them a little bit closer to Paleo for the legions of Crossfit fans that would flock to this truck. She remembered my message. I was impressed. They were so polite and eager to talk about their food with me. While we sat there and chatted for a bit about food, I got all glassy eyed at the incredible Asian candy/snack counter they had! Amazing! The vermicelli bowl was fantastic. I loved it and I can't wait to try the lemongrass chicken bowl. &#160;Also..can't wait to try their banh mi's! HUGE fan of the food, even bigger fan of the service!

Social Media - I have to say that one of the things I love about this truck and the owners is how they use social media. Long before Xplosive hit the road, there was buzz on the typical outlets like Facebook and Twitter. Before I went to the truck, I had not seen a menu, and I knew I wanted to try the food. I loved getting updates on how the truck was coming along, seeing the beautiful paint job, and even seeing it being stocked for the first week in action. Food Quality - The food was very good. I questioned the menu choices at the Rodeo but it's hard to know what people are going to want (especially with 45+ trucks). Those of us who attend food truck gatherings can't necessarily carbo-load on a foot long bahn mi since we want to eat at other trucks as well. However, it was difficult to argue with the well-marinated meat, crisp, fresh veggies, and crusty bread. The tacos were very good and Xplosive offered a trio of them, which I thought was a great idea and much smaller portion than the bahn mi. A friend of mine (not a tofu eater) said that was the best tofu he had ever tasted and he is now a believer. The fact that the truck has goodies like Yan Yan and Pineapple flavored marshmallows is a bonus. I feel like I'm a kid again in a small town in Hawaii with my few dollars getting ready to buy a treat. It's a nice touch that I appreciate and I'm sure others do as well. I am so happy that I can find the truck at South Lake Union (starting this week). I was worried that the route would keep me away from all the goodness that is Xplosive.Customer Service - The staff is really, really friendly. At the Rodeo, there was more than enough staff (something that newer trucks may overlook). They had at least 3 people outside the truck and I believe 3-4 people inside the truck. When there were slow periods, staff walked the streets handing out high quality postcards advertising the truck. It's that kind of attitude that will bring the customers in.I'm looking forward to seeing Xplosive often. I think they're off to a great start and have the qualities that will build them a solid fan base.\"}, {'review_id': 'Wu5az6Bl0INUp5OEFintXw', 'business_id': '0iyzWPc4C58sAJUAAE-BIg', 'user_id': '6Y1vjj8j6eZIbIZh_1HeYQ', 'date': '2012-11-10', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': 'This place tries to copy the Marination Mobile menu. &#160;How unoriginal and disgusting!

However, I never was lucky enough to see it...until last week. I exited Crossfit SLU in the alley at the end of lunch time and there it was gleaming in the sunlight! No line in front, it beckoned me with its shiny black exterior and clean silver counters. Hello Panda boxes winked at me, I'm sure of it. Clouds parted, angels sang..all of that. When I get on a food kick it can last an awful long time. Lately I've been eating vermicelli bowls like nobody's business. They had one left, it was a tofu vermicelli bowl. I reached deep in to my pockets only to realize that all I had was a roll of quarters. I left my debit card at home! Oh noes! So what do I do? Do I embarrass myself and pay in ALL quarters or simply try to catch this unicorn of a food truck another time? I paid $6 in quarters, they didn't mind. I smile at the ladies in the truck and told them that I had once messaged them about a suggestion I had to wrap their banh mi sandwiches in lettuce, making them a little bit closer to Paleo for the legions of Crossfit fans that would flock to this truck. She remembered my message. I was impressed. They were so polite and eager to talk about their food with me. While we sat there and chatted for a bit about food, I got all glassy eyed at the incredible Asian candy/snack counter they had! Amazing! The vermicelli bowl was fantastic. I loved it and I can't wait to try the lemongrass chicken bowl. &#160;Also..can't wait to try their banh mi's! HUGE fan of the food, even bigger fan of the service! If you ever have a hankering for Filipino or Vietnamese food, follow their FB or their Twitter to see where they'll be parked. I may end up stalking these folks at least once a week...or until they get a restaurant.

Social Media - I have to say that one of the things I love about this truck and the owners is how they use social media. Long before Xplosive hit the road, there was buzz on the typical outlets like Facebook and Twitter. Before I went to the truck, I had not seen a menu, and I knew I wanted to try the food. I loved getting updates on how the truck was coming along, seeing the beautiful paint job, and even seeing it being stocked for the first week in action. Food Quality - The food was very good. I questioned the menu choices at the Rodeo but it's hard to know what people are going to want (especially with 45+ trucks). Those of us who attend food truck gatherings can't necessarily carbo-load on a foot long bahn mi since we want to eat at other trucks as well. However, it was difficult to argue with the well-marinated meat, crisp, fresh veggies, and crusty bread. The tacos were very good and Xplosive offered a trio of them, which I thought was a great idea and much smaller portion than the bahn mi. A friend of mine (not a tofu eater) said that was the best tofu he had ever tasted and he is now a believer. The fact that the truck has goodies like Yan Yan and Pineapple flavored marshmallows is a bonus. I feel like I'm a kid again in a small town in Hawaii with my few dollars getting ready to buy a treat. It's a nice touch that I appreciate and I'm sure others do as well. I am so happy that I can find the truck at South Lake Union (starting this week). I was worried that the route would keep me away from all the goodness that is Xplosive.Customer Service - The staff is really, really friendly. At the Rodeo, there was more than enough staff (something that newer trucks may overlook). They had at least 3 people outside the truck and I believe 3-4 people inside the truck. When there were slow periods, staff walked the streets handing out high quality postcards advertising the truck. It's that kind of attitude that will bring the customers in.I'm looking forward to seeing Xplosive often. I think they're off to a great start and have the qualities that will build them a solid fan base.\"}, {'review_id': 'Wu5az6Bl0INUp5OEFintXw', 'business_id': '0iyzWPc4C58sAJUAAE-BIg', 'user_id': '6Y1vjj8j6eZIbIZh_1HeYQ', 'date': '2012-11-10', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': 'This place tries to copy the Marination Mobile menu. &#160;How unoriginal and disgusting!

However, I never was lucky enough to see it...until last week. I exited Crossfit SLU in the alley at the end of lunch time and there it was gleaming in the sunlight! No line in front, it beckoned me with its shiny black exterior and clean silver counters. Hello Panda boxes winked at me, I'm sure of it. Clouds parted, angels sang..all of that. When I get on a food kick it can last an awful long time. Lately I've been eating vermicelli bowls like nobody's business. They had one left, it was a tofu vermicelli bowl. I reached deep in to my pockets only to realize that all I had was a roll of quarters. I left my debit card at home! Oh noes! So what do I do? Do I embarrass myself and pay in ALL quarters or simply try to catch this unicorn of a food truck another time? I paid $6 in quarters, they didn't mind. I smile at the ladies in the truck and told them that I had once messaged them about a suggestion I had to wrap their banh mi sandwiches in lettuce, making them a little bit closer to Paleo for the legions of Crossfit fans that would flock to this truck. She remembered my message. I was impressed. They were so polite and eager to talk about their food with me. While we sat there and chatted for a bit about food, I got all glassy eyed at the incredible Asian candy/snack counter they had! Amazing! The vermicelli bowl was fantastic. I loved it and I can't wait to try the lemongrass chicken bowl. &#160;Also..can't wait to try their banh mi's! HUGE fan of the food, even bigger fan of the service!

Social Media - I have to say that one of the things I love about this truck and the owners is how they use social media. Long before Xplosive hit the road, there was buzz on the typical outlets like Facebook and Twitter. Before I went to the truck, I had not seen a menu, and I knew I wanted to try the food. I loved getting updates on how the truck was coming along, seeing the beautiful paint job, and even seeing it being stocked for the first week in action. Food Quality - The food was very good. I questioned the menu choices at the Rodeo but it's hard to know what people are going to want (especially with 45+ trucks). Those of us who attend food truck gatherings can't necessarily carbo-load on a foot long bahn mi since we want to eat at other trucks as well. However, it was difficult to argue with the well-marinated meat, crisp, fresh veggies, and crusty bread. The tacos were very good and Xplosive offered a trio of them, which I thought was a great idea and much smaller portion than the bahn mi. A friend of mine (not a tofu eater) said that was the best tofu he had ever tasted and he is now a believer. The fact that the truck has goodies like Yan Yan and Pineapple flavored marshmallows is a bonus. I feel like I'm a kid again in a small town in Hawaii with my few dollars getting ready to buy a treat. It's a nice touch that I appreciate and I'm sure others do as well. I am so happy that I can find the truck at South Lake Union (starting this week). I was worried that the route would keep me away from all the goodness that is Xplosive.Customer Service - The staff is really, really friendly. At the Rodeo, there was more than enough staff (something that newer trucks may overlook). They had at least 3 people outside the truck and I believe 3-4 people inside the truck. When there were slow periods, staff walked the streets handing out high quality postcards advertising the truck. It's that kind of attitude that will bring the customers in.I'm looking forward to seeing Xplosive often. I think they're off to a great start and have the qualities that will build them a solid fan base.\"}, {'review_id': 'Wu5az6Bl0INUp5OEFintXw', 'business_id': '0iyzWPc4C58sAJUAAE-BIg', 'user_id': '6Y1vjj8j6eZIbIZh_1HeYQ', 'date': '2012-11-10', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': 'This place tries to copy the Marination Mobile menu. &#160;How unoriginal and disgusting!

I look forward to my next visit.\"}, {'review_id': '7adJlBlmf8pCzshLp6cTlw', 'business_id': 'IbRT1K1TQ7mFXjlIZ9onUw', 'user_id': '1swR19tuYCsKBTEqmv7s5A', 'date': '2009-03-16', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"The nicest family runs this place. &#160;You can't get better customer service. &#160;The breakfast is simple, yet there never is anything wrong, and the price is too good to pass up.It gets crowded on weekends, so be patient.\"}, {'review_id': 'x0djXyb8AUfSNNzOYwVK7w', 'business_id': 'IbRT1K1TQ7mFXjlIZ9onUw', 'user_id': 'HI3CVYpg_GXNl0P-dC8KDA', 'date': '2010-06-24', 'stars': 5.0, 'text': \"Me and my boyfriend love this place.

Friendly staff checked up on me and I greatly enjoyed people watching.

My initial tip-off on this restaurant was from a guy from Beijing who drove all the way over from Lake Sammamish area for authentic food from Beijing and recommended it to us. My husband and I had a dish described to us by the waitress which is actually on the Mandarin-only menu, which is where some of the best, most interesting food at Yu Shan appears. The dish consisted of fried black mushrooms in strips, with onion strips, lots of garlic, and lots of cilantro!!! For us, the dish was so good I\\'d make a trip for it alone. I can\\'t remember the other dishes we ordered on that occasion, but they were very tasty.On the second occasion, I was with a large group of Chinese friends of mine, and we had so many different dishes, all had been ordered in advance, and they were all simply wonderful. Recently, I had lunch with a friend of mine, herself from a northern province of China. We had excellent food, including about 2 or 3 items from the Chinese-only menu. I loved everything, including those \"breakfast strips\", or whatever they are called: fried strips rolled up in a pancake/omelet, or something like that. We also had a sizzling rice dish, because I miss the days when most Chinese restaurants had nice large rice crusts to sop up soup or sauce. I was very happy to know there was still a place that makes them.The main thing about this restaurant is that it is NORTHERN Chinese food. So, all you Americans who think Chinese food is Kung Bao Chicken, Fried Rice, and Cantonese style dumplings, you need to learn that China is one very huge country. There are different food traditions in each area of China. Don\\'t have a Beijing dumpling and criticize it because it isn\\'t like a Cantonese dumpling. There\\'s nothing inauthentic about Yu Shan. And it\\'s always full of Chinese customers, so I hope no one else who reads Yelp first will come back and claim that this is Americanized Chinese food. Of course, if you don\\'t like it, you don\\'t like it, but that\\'s a personal taste issueIf the restaurant would attempt to translate the Chinese menu into English, I\\'d give them 5 stars!!'}, {'review_id': 'R8sh-tY50fvyWWziqiAQwg', 'business_id': '0rqp9CbHsZZEw1UOUHInWg', 'user_id': 'aatS3LGubDoDwECJNQu_eQ', 'date': '2011-10-02', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': 'We didn\\'t have anything to eat after sitting there for 45 minutes.(Sorry about the long story and if you don\\'t have patient to read through, take my score and go.)My wife and I were exciting about so-called \"Beijing-style\" Chinese food there. We didn\\'t even check out the yelp score here which you definitely do it right. Always check out yelp review first.We went in and sat down and a nice girl welcomed us. Everything seemed fine until we ordered. The lady taking order was rude and didn\\'t explain anything. One strike.We ordered three entrees and one noodle because our kitchen is remodeling. And then came the 45 minutes wait. No one took care of us. No hot tea refill. No chatting. Nothing. And what\\'s even worse is that another big table, 8~10 guys there, who were later than us, had more than 6 entrees served. What? Is it us two starving people with nothing and 10 guys with full covered table? Unfair. Second strike.Than we asked the manager about our order and she came and left. It seems she did asked the kitchen something through that little window. But then she left! No, not coming back and telling us what\\'s going on. She disappeared. And we\\'re like confusing and starving and wondering at the same time. Everyone were so busy walking back and forth but no one even take a look at us. Third strike.Since the manager disappeared, we complained to the waitress and left. We went there expecting happiness and left even more starvingly. The manager eventually captured us at the parking lot and asked us why. And even at that time, she didn\\'t know what happened and asked us not to be mad because her crews are newly hired. What?

Economically speaking, these business must serve this blasphemous dishes to keep in business. Why? Because the greater American population can\\'t tell good Chinese cuisine from the mutant chicken entrails they\\'re cooking up at McD\\'s. Just like how \"pad thai\" is not actually a thai dish, neither is sweet &amp; sour pork. You know that sauce is made from ketchup right? No authentic place in China is gonna have some Heinz chilling in the back kitchen to cook you up some sweet and sour (read: fatass) sauce. Anyway, I came here today with a big group of my family\\'s friends. Some were from Beijing, which is the cuisine served here. They ordered Beijing specialties like the meat pancake and the duck. I ordered my usual Shanghai fare. Fantastic. Let\\'s break it down:House pork buns: The best I\\'ve had in the greater Seattle area. No lie. While these are not the regular \"xiao long bao\" you expect (they have a fluffier bun), they are juicy and have great meat. Man I devoured 2 within seconds. I\\'m definitely coming back just for these.Garlic eggplant: I like to think I\\'m an eggplant specialist. I order this dish everywhere. The flavor was great, but the skin of the eggplant was a bit chewy. Must\\'ve been a deep-fry error.Fried buns: I\\'m not sure how to describe this properly. They are \"bun strips\" that are fried with pork. It looks like noodles. It was fantastic--much better than the \"nian gao\" we usually fry with the same ingredients.Pea sprouts: Good, but needed more oil. The sprouts were not as young as I would\\'ve liked.Duck: Average. Make sure to ask for the special authentic wrapper (looks like a tortilla). It\\'s much better than the steamed bun things.Meat pancake: Good, but the crust was too thick. Good meat inside though! But the same meat as the pork buns.Flower fish: Amazing fish. This fish is specially cut and then deep fried in sauce so when served, the meat flakes beautifully so the fish looks like a flower. It was deelish. Fried \"breakfast sticks\": If you\\'re from China, you know what I\\'m talking about. These breakfast sticks are wrapped in egg/flour combo and served together. Quite tasty, even though it looks weird. Cold sliced beef: Always a Chinese favorite, this was made wonderfully well and topped with fresh parsley. Little sauce, very fresh.Red bean bars: As dessert, we got this. It was a bit too sweet and a tad oily but still pretty good.The hostess and the waitress were super nice to us. Granted, so spoke Chinese so they liked us a lot more. Ambiance: Well, it\\'s across the street from Deja Vu showgirls. C\\'mon -- Lake City Way is not exactly Bellevue. But who cares? The food is fantastic.Price: So worth it. How do I emphasize that without stretching the ooo\\'s on my \"SO\"?I recommend Yu Shan for a real, solid Chinese meal.

A common theme I see among the reviews is that people order dishes like fried rice and orange chicken. I'm not saying they shouldn't order these things or that they aren't crappy as people say but I really believe the strength of Yu Shan lies in the Northern Chinese dian xing (dim sum) items they offer.If you've only ever had Cantonese style dim sum, which is probably true for 99% of Americans, this might be pretty different. The Northern Chinese dim sum fare they offer here are excellent and made fresh. Me and my parents ordered the niu rou xian bing (beef pancakes), jiu cai he zi (chives pancakes), cha shao bao (pork buns), jiao zi (hand-made dumplings), Beijing-style xiao long bao (little dragon buns), dou jiang (fresh soy milk), and dou sha bing (red bean cake). Everything was fresh and extremely delicious although I prefer Shanghai-style xiao long bao over Beijing-style because the outer bun is a lot thinner. Next time we go we want to try the luo bo si bing (radish cakes) since you have to order them two days in advance for them to make it fresh.Yu Shan is near Bothell and pretty far away from where I live but I would definitely come here again. The outside of the restaurant is pretty run down and in a pretty shady neighborhood but the inside is adequately furnished and not so bad. The service was nothing special even though we were Chinese so I can imagine if you're not Chinese, service might be worse. If you come here, I can't vouch for the quality of their non dim sum items. Honestly, a lot of those menu items sounded like Americanized Chinese food (Kung Pao chicken aybody?). Try out their dim sum items and you might be pleasantly surprised.\"}, {'review_id': 'WP0SdMenUFJ03ANTYXI2bg', 'business_id': '0rqp9CbHsZZEw1UOUHInWg', 'user_id': 'y2LXgBlLKxlkjJxCv8Fv5A', 'date': '2010-02-09', 'stars': 5.0, 'text': 'LOVE this place - Food - 5*.

Yes, I mean it. It could have been what we ordered, because I assume that Chicken Chow Mein would come out pretty standard here, but then again...The server that helped us was awesome, and very friendly. He was young, and easy to chat with. We ordered the fish in hot and spicy soup, garlic eggplant, and black pepper beef. He asked about spice level, and we told him go nuts, extra spicy, ma la, the works. We also asked a bit about other favorite Chinese dishes (my pronunciation isn\\'t great, so the iphone came out). He offered that if we called ahead with our requests, the kitchen would be able to make these dishes for us, despite them not being on the menu!! REALLY? Even a rather obscure and time-consuming sweet soup could be done. Impressive. I\\'ll be calling ahead for a special occasion, to be sure. When our meal came, we were both surprised to find the soup featured liberal use of szechuan peppercorns, which we love &amp; use at home, but are quite difficult to get in the States. It was mouth-tinglingly delicious, the peppercorns give it an interesting tingle that seems spicy, but isn\\'t painful to taste. The black pepper beef was a treat, chock full of little dried peppers and flavor. Again, a very masterful creation which was undoubtedly spicy, but never burning or overwhelming, or too lingering. Even the garlic eggplant had nice heat, perhaps a little richly sauced, but very good.I noticed that they had \"sliced pork with taro\" on the menu, a dish I\\'ve enjoyed greatly in China. I\\'ll be certain to try it here. I also believe that with the right conversation, more typical dishes like Mu Shu could come out quite well here. My only minor gripe, and this has been the case for Chinese food in Seattle in general, is that the issue of MSG is not addressed. I therefore assume that Yu Shan uses MSG. I don\\'t have an allergy, but I do like to limit consumption. Since they have been so pleasant with special requests, next time I\\'ll make a point of bringing this up with my order.

I've also tried the spareribs here which is also a hit. About 8.50 a plate. They have that perfect seasoning, so it's not too burnt or salty like other places I've experienced. Also tried the Chicken Katsu, YUM YUM alright, crispy and dipped to perfection with the sauce. I believe this is about 6.50?I was never a big fan of fried rice, but this place I can tolerate and more. There is so much flavor in the fried rice not to mention, superrr deals at I believe 5.99. I order ahead pretty often here. The service is super fast, the prices are great, and the food is superb! That's the real deal there. What more can you ask for? My cousin is a regular here. She calls and orders 2 orders of chicken fried rice every time (at least once a week) and they know her name and voice by heart through the phone.

The only reason this place is alive and kicking is because of their prime spot in Westlake Center and the constant new flow of people that go by...otherwise, I can't imagine this place having regulars. So if you don't want to read this long story/rant, the moral of this story is this place SUCKS and if their service was a smell, it'd be worst than a pile of manure on a hot summer day. So after having an amazing day out and enjoying the sun, we decided to get crepes and bubble tea. My friend and I ordered taro milk tea and my bf ordered a strawberry crepe with ice cream. When we went to the pick up area, the lady told us that they ran out of Taro...and we had to choose something else, and the choices were only honeydew or milk tea...so we chose milk tea. But no less than 3minutes later, they started serving masses of other people after us taro milk tea?! grr.....So we waited about 10minutes as people cycle through and get their crepes and we havent...my bf ask them about it and they totally forgot about it... So we wait another 5minutes to get it and finally take off...After biting the top of the crepe off thinking the ice cream was in the center..we find that they completely forgot to add it in and we return to the crepe place...we wait politely at the pick up place and NO one addresses us and they're not even busy...so eventually we have to call them out. When we told them about the ice cream, they had to go through their notes to verify and then we could see the owner and worker talk about it for a little bit...after getting a little awkward, they ask if we want to just put the ice cream ON TOP of the crepe ...wtf?? or put it in a cup....again..wtf?So my friend asks, can't they just redo it, since it's really not the same thing having ice cream on top...(i mean hell, we shoulda just got a damn ice cream cone somewhere if that was the case!)..but the owner says, no, we've ate all of it already and they will not redo it, even tho we ONLY ate the top part off to find out there was no ice cream, plus THEY goofed it up, not us. He then just walks away and ignores us and tells us that we only have the option to add ice cream in a cup or on top... I'm usually not confrontational but since hes so rude about it, I then bring up the taro milk tea issue since I'm upset now (haha..) and their story was that, AT THE TIME, they ran out of taro...but instead of asking if I wanted to wait an extra 2 minutes, they just say they are out..in the end..we just have to leave in disappointment and anger from the owners shi**y attitudes and customer service. Anyway...even the worker there agreed that the service there was bad....Overall, this place is lucky to be in business.

Still, they get the benefit of a doubt and start out at 3 stars in my book, like every other food place. I ordered the BBQ chicken and veggie crepe. &#160;I asked what was on it and she replied with a shy and somewhat confused smile that it had chicken, BBQ sauce, lettuce and corns (like, kernels or mini-corns or what? Who cares: its FOOD). &#160;I was hungry so I went ahead and ordered it anyway. &#160;She ran my CC then when before I signed the slip, she walked away, so I tucked the edge of it as far out of reach as I could but visible by the register. &#160;She did see me do that, but never gave me a CC receipt and the next day when the transaction cleared, I found out it cost a dollar more than I had thought. &#160;(3 stars dropped to 1 star for the clerk not seeing through the actual transaction)I watched another lady make the crepe which was fascinating all in itself, made in a decidedly non-French fashion. But then horror struck! &#160;Aw jeez, they pulled cheap block American cheese and shredded cold dark chicken thigh meat from the fridge, along with what looked like a half a cup of corn left over in a small tub. &#160;When the crepe was already done, she put the cold chicken on top then started to load it with salt and add the cheese on top! &#160;I stopped her and said no to any more salt or any cheese, then they asked me if I wanted ranch dressing on it. &#160;I said no, thinking to myself that this would have been more pleasant if when I asked what was on it in the first place, these additional items were disclosed on the outset. &#160;Then, she added the corn remainder and some cheap soggy chopped iceberg lettuce. &#160;Really, I should've just asked for her to remake it because she put ALOT of salt on it before I stopped her, but I didn't. &#160;(lost the 1 star, right there. We're at 0 stars right now)Nevertheless, here is where it gets quasi-better...the batter they used was obviously pancake batter, and was good as far as the flavor goes. &#160;the crepe was huge but was overcooked which made it crispy - this would compliment their dessert crepe selection quite nicely (think really thin waffle cone), but not so much on the savory crepes like what I ordered. &#160;When the crepe was done, it was folded really nicely then stuffed into a multi-layered wrapper. &#160;Precisely and tightly folded and presented really pretty. &#160;(add 2 stars)Problem is, the wrapper was such that you couldn't get to the food and the inside bits of the crepe without unfolding the wrapper somehow, and it was so tightly folded I couldn't do that without turning all the food out onto the floor. &#160;By now the crepe was steamed and a bit soggy, so it couldn't be pulled out by itself. Can't walk around with this - a fork was at least called for. &#160;When I asked for one, they gave me a tiny plate and...a spoon. Go figure.

Keep in mind with all of my teriyaki place reviews are based off of how I like their spicy chicken (if available; automatic one-star if they don't have spicy chicken :P). Their spicy chicken isn't terribly spicy, but the cuts of meat are pretty decent, their rice is also good. Not a fan of whatever the dressing is that they use on their cabbage (I think that's what it is) side salad that comes with pretty much every menu item. Their tempura is tasty, I've had both the vegetable and prawn.I don't go there anymore as I'm not a fan of their spicy chicken, but since West Seattle (namely the Junction area) doesn't have a ton of teriyaki places this is one worth mentioning. If you're not a fan of spicy stuff I'm sure that their other menu items would be worth checking out. Also, if you order in it seems like you get a bigger portion than you do from a take-out order.\"}, {'review_id': 'F8d0boDpgPq1mKEgvYHhKg', 'business_id': 'ZriNDCVxkCdVEO-X2sjHFw', 'user_id': '2kHVMmO8ESJTk_vN8Pn7RA', 'date': '2010-10-17', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"Honestly, my expectations were not that high. The decor looks miserable, the restrooms are right in the middle of the dining area, and they seemed to have an identity crisis - the menu was packed with all sorts of things you'd never expect a good teriyaki restaurant to have (udon? california rolls? korean BBQ short ribs? what?). Begrudgingly, I ordered a chicken teriyaki bento box (like in the picture someone else uploaded here) to satisfy my hunger.I've eaten at dozens of teriyaki restaurants in Washington, and I will state on the record that this place is in my top 5. The chicken was juicy and properly cooked - marinated in advance instead of having the sauce glaze over during cooking like some other places.I'm not a big fan of side salads with teriyaki, it's never really felt like a proper combination of flavor/texture to me. This time around it was no different, but I actually ended up starting and finishing my salad (a rarity) and even ENJOYING it. It's weird, but the way they cut their lettuce + awesomesauce dressing = palatable salad for me.Unless you're already in the area, I wouldn't recommend dining onsite as it's somewhat drab. Most people don't anyways - in the 20 minutes I was there, at least a dozen people came through to pickup their carryout orders. This place moves their product hardcore, and for good reason.P.S.

I wish someone would nominate their restaurant for some sort of makeover, because I live in fear this aptly named place will go out of business due to people judging a book by its cover. The good news is there's always plenty of seating!I love to order the Chicken Asparagus with Gyoza. I give all my chicken, half my rice, and some of my veggies to my four-year-old. He loves to go there and often requests it by name. The proprietors are so nice to him, always giving us an extra small plate so we can share, a steak knife so I can cut up his chicken, and a little cup with ice and a straw for the drink he loves to pick out from the refrigerated case. It's a very family-friendly restaurant in one of the best senses -- you don't have to be a family to eat there, and I see all types of groups and individuals come through, but the owners are welcoming to all. As far as noise level, even with us there, it's not a library, but it's pretty chill.My husband likes to alternate between the seafood teriyaki dishes and the tempura. The meat there (when I try a bite) is well seasoned and cooked to be just soft enough. The veggies always seem super fresh and vibrantly colored and retain a pleasant crunch. Nothing's overcooked, is what I'm saying.The rice and teriyaki sauce are good, too. Ha ha.It can be a little challenging to find street parking in the Junction, so we usually pass it up, turn around near Rite-Aid, and then find street parking on the correct side of the street just past the light and walk down. If you do have little kids, know that it's right next to a cool toy store and near the pet store. If you have a four-year-old, you'll understand the appeal. Plus, you could walk to Husky Deli or Cupcake Royale for dessert if anyone still has room.Seriously, this is my favorite teriyaki place to go to, and one of my favorite restaurants, period.

I ordered the premium chicken and pork combo and was pleasantly surprised by how good the sauce was and the quality of the meat. Honestly this was some of the best teriyaki I have had in Seattle. Not sure it would be my #1 place in Seattle but definitely my top five for sure. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because I didn't much care for my salad and the interior needs a make over.

This will be an addition to our regular rotation of great places to eat in WS!PS - one of our friends said the food alone was worth the drive to West Seattle...and he is from Issaquah!'}, {'review_id': '1pIZlx4k7U8S-_dX-kzb4w', 'business_id': 'ZriNDCVxkCdVEO-X2sjHFw', 'user_id': 'BKYMMC-DAPY-Oo14tdWA0A', 'date': '2011-11-15', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': 'Our favorite teriyaki in West Seattle!

My initial tip-off on this restaurant was from a guy from Beijing who drove all the way over from Lake Sammamish area for authentic food from Beijing and recommended it to us. My husband and I had a dish described to us by the waitress which is actually on the Mandarin-only menu, which is where some of the best, most interesting food at Yu Shan appears. The dish consisted of fried black mushrooms in strips, with onion strips, lots of garlic, and lots of cilantro!!! For us, the dish was so good I\\'d make a trip for it alone. I can\\'t remember the other dishes we ordered on that occasion, but they were very tasty.On the second occasion, I was with a large group of Chinese friends of mine, and we had so many different dishes, all had been ordered in advance, and they were all simply wonderful. Recently, I had lunch with a friend of mine, herself from a northern province of China. We had excellent food, including about 2 or 3 items from the Chinese-only menu. I loved everything, including those \"breakfast strips\", or whatever they are called: fried strips rolled up in a pancake/omelet, or something like that. We also had a sizzling rice dish, because I miss the days when most Chinese restaurants had nice large rice crusts to sop up soup or sauce. I was very happy to know there was still a place that makes them.The main thing about this restaurant is that it is NORTHERN Chinese food. So, all you Americans who think Chinese food is Kung Bao Chicken, Fried Rice, and Cantonese style dumplings, you need to learn that China is one very huge country. There are different food traditions in each area of China. Don\\'t have a Beijing dumpling and criticize it because it isn\\'t like a Cantonese dumpling. There\\'s nothing inauthentic about Yu Shan. And it\\'s always full of Chinese customers, so I hope no one else who reads Yelp first will come back and claim that this is Americanized Chinese food. Of course, if you don\\'t like it, you don\\'t like it, but that\\'s a personal taste issueIf the restaurant would attempt to translate the Chinese menu into English, I\\'d give them 5 stars!!'}, {'review_id': 'R8sh-tY50fvyWWziqiAQwg', 'business_id': '0rqp9CbHsZZEw1UOUHInWg', 'user_id': 'aatS3LGubDoDwECJNQu_eQ', 'date': '2011-10-02', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': 'We didn\\'t have anything to eat after sitting there for 45 minutes.(Sorry about the long story and if you don\\'t have patient to read through, take my score and go.)My wife and I were exciting about so-called \"Beijing-style\" Chinese food there. We didn\\'t even check out the yelp score here which you definitely do it right. Always check out yelp review first.We went in and sat down and a nice girl welcomed us. Everything seemed fine until we ordered. The lady taking order was rude and didn\\'t explain anything. One strike.We ordered three entrees and one noodle because our kitchen is remodeling.

And what\\'s even worse is that another big table, 8~10 guys there, who were later than us, had more than 6 entrees served. What? Is it us two starving people with nothing and 10 guys with full covered table? Unfair. Second strike.Than we asked the manager about our order and she came and left. It seems she did asked the kitchen something through that little window. But then she left! No, not coming back and telling us what\\'s going on. She disappeared. And we\\'re like confusing and starving and wondering at the same time. Everyone were so busy walking back and forth but no one even take a look at us. Third strike.Since the manager disappeared, we complained to the waitress and left. We went there expecting happiness and left even more starvingly. The manager eventually captured us at the parking lot and asked us why. And even at that time, she didn\\'t know what happened and asked us not to be mad because her crews are newly hired. What?

Economically speaking, these business must serve this blasphemous dishes to keep in business. Why? Because the greater American population can\\'t tell good Chinese cuisine from the mutant chicken entrails they\\'re cooking up at McD\\'s. Just like how \"pad thai\" is not actually a thai dish, neither is sweet &amp; sour pork. You know that sauce is made from ketchup right? No authentic place in China is gonna have some Heinz chilling in the back kitchen to cook you up some sweet and sour (read: fatass) sauce. Anyway, I came here today with a big group of my family\\'s friends. Some were from Beijing, which is the cuisine served here. They ordered Beijing specialties like the meat pancake and the duck. I ordered my usual Shanghai fare. Fantastic. Let\\'s break it down:House pork buns: The best I\\'ve had in the greater Seattle area. No lie. While these are not the regular \"xiao long bao\" you expect (they have a fluffier bun), they are juicy and have great meat. Man I devoured 2 within seconds. I\\'m definitely coming back just for these.Garlic eggplant: I like to think I\\'m an eggplant specialist. I order this dish everywhere. The flavor was great, but the skin of the eggplant was a bit chewy. Must\\'ve been a deep-fry error.Fried buns: I\\'m not sure how to describe this properly. They are \"bun strips\" that are fried with pork. It looks like noodles. It was fantastic--much better than the \"nian gao\" we usually fry with the same ingredients.Pea sprouts: Good, but needed more oil. The sprouts were not as young as I would\\'ve liked.Duck: Average. Make sure to ask for the special authentic wrapper (looks like a tortilla). It\\'s much better than the steamed bun things.Meat pancake: Good, but the crust was too thick. Good meat inside though! But the same meat as the pork buns.Flower fish: Amazing fish. This fish is specially cut and then deep fried in sauce so when served, the meat flakes beautifully so the fish looks like a flower. It was deelish. Fried \"breakfast sticks\": If you\\'re from China, you know what I\\'m talking about. These breakfast sticks are wrapped in egg/flour combo and served together. Quite tasty, even though it looks weird. Cold sliced beef: Always a Chinese favorite, this was made wonderfully well and topped with fresh parsley. Little sauce, very fresh.Red bean bars: As dessert, we got this. It was a bit too sweet and a tad oily but still pretty good.The hostess and the waitress were super nice to us. Granted, so spoke Chinese so they liked us a lot more. Ambiance: Well, it\\'s across the street from Deja Vu showgirls. C\\'mon -- Lake City Way is not exactly Bellevue. But who cares? The food is fantastic.Price: So worth it. How do I emphasize that without stretching the ooo\\'s on my \"SO\"?I recommend Yu Shan for a real, solid Chinese meal.

A common theme I see among the reviews is that people order dishes like fried rice and orange chicken. I'm not saying they shouldn't order these things or that they aren't crappy as people say but I really believe the strength of Yu Shan lies in the Northern Chinese dian xing (dim sum) items they offer.If you've only ever had Cantonese style dim sum, which is probably true for 99% of Americans, this might be pretty different. The Northern Chinese dim sum fare they offer here are excellent and made fresh. Me and my parents ordered the niu rou xian bing (beef pancakes), jiu cai he zi (chives pancakes), cha shao bao (pork buns), jiao zi (hand-made dumplings), Beijing-style xiao long bao (little dragon buns), dou jiang (fresh soy milk), and dou sha bing (red bean cake). Everything was fresh and extremely delicious although I prefer Shanghai-style xiao long bao over Beijing-style because the outer bun is a lot thinner. Next time we go we want to try the luo bo si bing (radish cakes) since you have to order them two days in advance for them to make it fresh.Yu Shan is near Bothell and pretty far away from where I live but I would definitely come here again. The outside of the restaurant is pretty run down and in a pretty shady neighborhood but the inside is adequately furnished and not so bad. The service was nothing special even though we were Chinese so I can imagine if you're not Chinese, service might be worse. If you come here, I can't vouch for the quality of their non dim sum items. Honestly, a lot of those menu items sounded like Americanized Chinese food (Kung Pao chicken aybody?). Try out their dim sum items and you might be pleasantly surprised.\"}, {'review_id': 'WP0SdMenUFJ03ANTYXI2bg', 'business_id': '0rqp9CbHsZZEw1UOUHInWg', 'user_id': 'y2LXgBlLKxlkjJxCv8Fv5A', 'date': '2010-02-09', 'stars': 5.0, 'text': 'LOVE this place - Food - 5*.

Yes, I mean it. It could have been what we ordered, because I assume that Chicken Chow Mein would come out pretty standard here, but then again...The server that helped us was awesome, and very friendly. He was young, and easy to chat with. We ordered the fish in hot and spicy soup, garlic eggplant, and black pepper beef. He asked about spice level, and we told him go nuts, extra spicy, ma la, the works. We also asked a bit about other favorite Chinese dishes (my pronunciation isn\\'t great, so the iphone came out). He offered that if we called ahead with our requests, the kitchen would be able to make these dishes for us, despite them not being on the menu!! REALLY? Even a rather obscure and time-consuming sweet soup could be done. Impressive. I\\'ll be calling ahead for a special occasion, to be sure. When our meal came, we were both surprised to find the soup featured liberal use of szechuan peppercorns, which we love &amp; use at home, but are quite difficult to get in the States. It was mouth-tinglingly delicious, the peppercorns give it an interesting tingle that seems spicy, but isn\\'t painful to taste. The black pepper beef was a treat, chock full of little dried peppers and flavor. Again, a very masterful creation which was undoubtedly spicy, but never burning or overwhelming, or too lingering. Even the garlic eggplant had nice heat, perhaps a little richly sauced, but very good.I noticed that they had \"sliced pork with taro\" on the menu, a dish I\\'ve enjoyed greatly in China. I\\'ll be certain to try it here. I also believe that with the right conversation, more typical dishes like Mu Shu could come out quite well here. My only minor gripe, and this has been the case for Chinese food in Seattle in general, is that the issue of MSG is not addressed. I therefore assume that Yu Shan uses MSG. I don\\'t have an allergy, but I do like to limit consumption. Since they have been so pleasant with special requests, next time I\\'ll make a point of bringing this up with my order.

Keep in mind with all of my teriyaki place reviews are based off of how I like their spicy chicken (if available; automatic one-star if they don't have spicy chicken :P). Their spicy chicken isn't terribly spicy, but the cuts of meat are pretty decent, their rice is also good. Not a fan of whatever the dressing is that they use on their cabbage (I think that's what it is) side salad that comes with pretty much every menu item. Their tempura is tasty, I've had both the vegetable and prawn.I don't go there anymore as I'm not a fan of their spicy chicken, but since West Seattle (namely the Junction area) doesn't have a ton of teriyaki places this is one worth mentioning. If you're not a fan of spicy stuff I'm sure that their other menu items would be worth checking out. Also, if you order in it seems like you get a bigger portion than you do from a take-out order.\"}, {'review_id': 'F8d0boDpgPq1mKEgvYHhKg', 'business_id': 'ZriNDCVxkCdVEO-X2sjHFw', 'user_id': '2kHVMmO8ESJTk_vN8Pn7RA', 'date': '2010-10-17', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"Honestly, my expectations were not that high. The decor looks miserable, the restrooms are right in the middle of the dining area, and they seemed to have an identity crisis - the menu was packed with all sorts of things you'd never expect a good teriyaki restaurant to have (udon? california rolls? korean BBQ short ribs? what?). Begrudgingly, I ordered a chicken teriyaki bento box (like in the picture someone else uploaded here) to satisfy my hunger.I've eaten at dozens of teriyaki restaurants in Washington, and I will state on the record that this place is in my top 5. The chicken was juicy and properly cooked - marinated in advance instead of having the sauce glaze over during cooking like some other places.I'm not a big fan of side salads with teriyaki, it's never really felt like a proper combination of flavor/texture to me. This time around it was no different, but I actually ended up starting and finishing my salad (a rarity) and even ENJOYING it. It's weird, but the way they cut their lettuce + awesomesauce dressing = palatable salad for me.Unless you're already in the area, I wouldn't recommend dining onsite as it's somewhat drab. Most people don't anyways - in the 20 minutes I was there, at least a dozen people came through to pickup their carryout orders. This place moves their product hardcore, and for good reason.P.S.

I wish someone would nominate their restaurant for some sort of makeover, because I live in fear this aptly named place will go out of business due to people judging a book by its cover. The good news is there's always plenty of seating!I love to order the Chicken Asparagus with Gyoza. I give all my chicken, half my rice, and some of my veggies to my four-year-old. He loves to go there and often requests it by name. The proprietors are so nice to him, always giving us an extra small plate so we can share, a steak knife so I can cut up his chicken, and a little cup with ice and a straw for the drink he loves to pick out from the refrigerated case. It's a very family-friendly restaurant in one of the best senses -- you don't have to be a family to eat there, and I see all types of groups and individuals come through, but the owners are welcoming to all. As far as noise level, even with us there, it's not a library, but it's pretty chill.My husband likes to alternate between the seafood teriyaki dishes and the tempura. The meat there (when I try a bite) is well seasoned and cooked to be just soft enough. The veggies always seem super fresh and vibrantly colored and retain a pleasant crunch. Nothing's overcooked, is what I'm saying.The rice and teriyaki sauce are good, too. Ha ha.It can be a little challenging to find street parking in the Junction, so we usually pass it up, turn around near Rite-Aid, and then find street parking on the correct side of the street just past the light and walk down. If you do have little kids, know that it's right next to a cool toy store and near the pet store. If you have a four-year-old, you'll understand the appeal. Plus, you could walk to Husky Deli or Cupcake Royale for dessert if anyone still has room.Seriously, this is my favorite teriyaki place to go to, and one of my favorite restaurants, period.

My partner and I decided to treat 16 of our out of town wedding guests to brunch at Ivar\\'s - a true Pacific Northwest dining experience. Unfortunately, the service we received left a sour taste in our mouth; one so bad that they should be ashamed. We arrived at 9:30 and were shortly seated. 15 minutes after we arrived the bus boy came by and asked if anyone had \"checked-in\" with us yet. We told him know and he took a few of our drink orders. The drinks came and we continued to wait. 45 minutes later we still had not been introduced to our waiter. This was very frustrating considering that there were many waiters walking around us, there were very few people in the restaurant, and when I tried to flag them down I received a dirty look. I decided to work my way to the hostess because I had no luck with the waiters. The hostess was nice enough, though she did not know how to address the problem. She explained that we should go ahead and eat because we \"didn\\'t want any special orders anyway.\" This was obviously not the case considering we were a wedding party! Why do they discourage extra income?! We did go through the brunch line and gave up on anything that wasn\\'t already prepared (our guests had flights to catch). The food was descent enough. It is what you would expect from a moderately priced buffet - it is not quite Salty\\'s but it is still descent. It was obvious that the food was not cycled properly and became dry easily. We quickly finished our meal and I gestured to THREE waiters. None came. Instead, a group of waiters were in the corner chatting and laughing while one folded napkins on a nearby table (incredibly tacky). 30 minutes later the bill came, and it sat with the credit card for another 20 or so minutes. When I got up to take it to the front someone came and grabbed the card from me (I think the bus boy). This experience was disgusting, exhausting, and Ivar\\'s should be ashamed. This was the worst dining experience I have ever experienced, and I have attended a wedding reception where the restaurant forgot about the wedding party - it was that bad.

We had a group of 5 and were scared that without reservations, the place would be packed. Fortunately, we were seated outside (per request) and enjoyed an awesome seafood dinner overlooking the water.Good things- Happy hour: Every day from 3pm until closing, Happy hour is one of the best deals I can think of. There is a special Happy hour menu that consists of each item that is on the dinner menu, with $3 off every item. The portions are smaller, but you still feel like you're getting a steal.- Salmon: The restaurants' namesake, the salmon is really tasty here. I got the sampler that came with a piece of Coho (pretty dry, don't get it) and the King (so flaky and tender! Go with this one!). Both pieces were perfectly seasoned, not overdone, and the freshness of the fish really shined. My salmon sampler that is regularly $19 ended up being $16. So wonderful!- Fish and Chips: The pieces of fish were huge, so it was really great for sharing. Large steak fries come with the meal. This was surprisingly not too heavy, considering it's like consuming a giant bucket of oil haha.- Service: Food came out relatively quickly and our waitress was helpful with recommendations. Everyone looks like they have fun working there, which makes it a better experience for all the restaurant-goers.So as I'm reviewing all these Seattle places from my trip, I'm realizing there are very few places/things I didn't like.

We sat outside and ordered a few drinks on their spacious deck.We went there on a weekday so we expected it to be pretty calm and easy. And it was for the most part, except that they appeared to be severely understaffed that day. It looked like there was one poor waiter (who did a fabulous job) who was manning the entire outside deck. Our waitress was wonderful as well. It looked like she was helping him out when she seated us. Anyways, the drinks were great, but our chief complaint was with the food. I ordered the salmon special and it appeared to be raw. I'm no seafood aficionado so I asked the waitress if that was normal. She was quick to say no and immediately got me a new plate, which was nice of her. My wife, on the other hand ordered the Halibut special and it arrived to our table cold which was disappointing.After talking with a few of the people at my workplace, it sounds that this place is typically very good. So, maybe we just happened on a bad day. But, for being a weekday, we expected a less busy kitchen to have no problem preparing fresh seafood.

The spread at the Sunday buffet is amazing, and if the $24 dollar price tag scares you, don't worry- you can eat that much in the raw oysters and crab legs they have and not worry about being full. The emphasis is on seafood, but there are a few items that even pickier eaters could enjoy, such as a nice meat and cheese plate and fish and chips. Our table polished off two plates of crab legs and a small plate of oysters on the half shell before we decided to grab what we individually wanted- an awesome deal. I haven't eaten in the bar, only in the main dining area, and the service can be a smidge on the slow side when it's packed, but I can totally understand why.

I see a lot of reviews for the buffet, and I\\'m not sure if that\\'s what I would want to try from this place - I\\'ve heard that as much of a tourist brand as Ivar\\'s is, they do know their fish, and I think that\\'s apparent. We started with calamari and a cup of smoked salmon chowder - the calamari was delicious. Extremely tender, far more so that I typically get, and with good light batter and plenty of fresh lemon to squeeze. They do serve with marinara, which is my least favorite calamari sauce, but that\\'s OK - I didn\\'t need it. The chowder was extremely tasty, with big solid chunks of smoked salmon and tender potato in a nice base. Very very good. My entree was a white king salmon over a sort of Greek vegetable medley and topped with some yogurt sauce. I would never have thought to pair strong flavors like that with what was a very mild but very well done piece of fish, but it worked perfectly. The fish had great grill taste, and was nice and flaky, but was maybe the tiniest hint overdone. Others had some really delicious sockeye salmon in a cold tomato gazpacho and a pink king salmon with rice and sauteed zucchini. Plus a delicious seafood salad with a smoked scallop and delicious rare seared ahi tuna, among other things. Everything was really good. Our server was patient in explaining to out of towners the difference between the various salmon types they had on offer. I\\'ve heard the breakdown before, but couldn\\'t remember, so it was good to hear again. It can be a bit expensive, especially if you go for appetizers and drinks, but this was the \"big meal\" of a weekend in Washington state, so I have no complaints.

For $27.50, the food and service is worth every penny. &#160;As most Americans, I dont mind paying for quality when it is warranted. And this place always leaves me smiliing.Parking is usually in abundance out front, on only one occasion I had to circle the block, but that was for happy hour on a sunny day, in late spring, which for people in Seattle is like having free cocktails at an AA meeting. Sunny days in spring never happen, and when they do, sitting outside enjoying food and cocktails are a premium, especially by the water. Another reason why this spot is 5 star fresh!Back to brunch, meat, theyll have the breakfast regulars like bacon and sausage but they have the cured meats like coppa and salami, and the they had a lamb roast as well as prime rib. Meats are an A+. Theres also an omelette station and a crepe station where you can \"order to your liking\" of different omelettes and crepes. The crepe station however didnt have bananas not did they have nutella, which any fat kid like myself would tell ya, are crepe necessities. &#160;Omelette station A, crepe station C. Seafood is dope! They have fresh salmon, baked and raw slices as well. (I like it raw) They have shrimp, crab, clams, oysters, and mussels all prepared in a variety of ways. Im a crab fiend and am real picky with all-you-can-eat crab and this was quality stuff. Seafood A. Where was the lobster at homey??There are also a wide variety of salads, side dishes and other entrees that are worth mentioning but I stuck to my salumi, meats, seafood and omelette and didnt have too much room for anything else but dessert. But they looked amazing, they had pancakes, french toast, eggs benedict, country style potatoes, noodles, and I can keep going, but you get the picture.Desserts. The desserts were okay, they had a variety of things but nothing that i tasted was memorable. However what saves the desserts were they had a chocolate fountain. And whenever you have chocolate in liquid state for me to play with, thats a plus, I always think of Augustus Gloop in the ol school Willy Wonka movie, the German boy that fell in the chocolate river. I might possibly like chocolate more than that dude. They had strawberries, pineapples, marshmallows ahhh it was a chocolatey delight. Desserts B.All soft drinks are included and the juices here are great. The apple juice was one of the tastiest fresh pressed apple juices Ive had from anywhere. Also when I went, they had $2 mimosas, so I had a few of those and they are an awesome value for 2 bucks!! Drinks A+Now that was just brunch. Happy hour here is solid too. On a nice sunny day, try to get here as early as possible cause if you get here after 6, youll probably have at least an hour wait, no matter how small your party is (but thats to sit outside, faster if you wanna sit indoors). &#160;The happy hour changes season to season, ive seen anything from pulled pork sliders to bbq ribs to pasta, but theyll always have the good ol\\' burger and fries and clam chowder.

This is worth mentioning because I honestly felt like our service could have been better, which I felt was directly related to the fact that the assumption was made that we were probably too young to tip properly. At the very least, our server was a little too astonished at my age when she carded me for a drink (because we all know that the high school kids come in and order Jack Daniels and diet Coke, not those frou frou drinks on the back of the menu).HOWEVER -We only waited 15 minutes to be seated without a reservation, all food and drinks arrived promptly, and the food here is delicious. We had a trio platter appetizer, which fortunately seems to feature the calamari.

A fantastic batch of breaded and fried halibut with a gaggle of fries on the side = paradise in my eyes. Still on the search for that perfect example of English fare, it makes every sense in the world that I jump inside the self-proclaimed Seattle staple... Ivar\\'s. After living in Seattle for years now, I\\'ve yet to step foot inside an Ivar\\'s location. Why? Eh... the fast-food vibe of the one nearest to me (located in Ballard off 15th ave) shrugged me away. Sure that might have been grouping the chain as a whole into an unwanted destination - but the Taco Bell just south looked equally appetizing. And as well all know, Taco Bell reminds me more of bowel movements than edible food. Luckily, a group of amazing folks from this random website (I think it was called... Yelp, or something like that) decided to meet for a book club at the Salmon House location. Me - liking both fish \\'n\\' chips as well as the chance to act slightly intellectual in a social environment - jumped at the chance. I headed over with my trusty old book and ordered up. First thing I noticed was the noise. I love a restaurant with a subtle ambiance, where one can actually hear those seated around the table. But it was very difficult to discuss a book with a gigantic monster of an interstate looming right over head. The views from the deck area are amazing, but damn those noisy cars! Quite often we were repeating ourselves despite sitting a few feet away. Oh, and the absence of malt vinegar is another sign that they are not exactly being traditional with their fish/fry dish. (Yes, they brought some on request.) Enough of the location, I was here for one thing and one thing only: deep-fried halibut goodness. (Don\\'t hate me, but the book thing was secretly secondary. Tee hee...) They arrived on what looked like a sheet of newspaper - not something I normally find appetizing. Fries = cut rate, basic sticks of potato that had lacked any seasoning other than the iodine-rich salt. I love me some fries, but as I\\'ve said in the past enjoy some oomph with the side dish. Speaking of seasoning, the fish lacked any. There are plenty of great ways to compliment the flavors found in halibut - or any fish for that matter - that they should be exploited to their fullest. I will say that the breading/frying part of the ordeal was definitely better than Chinooks. Not soggy by any stretch of the means, with a nice light crunch. The fish was fantastic, wonderfully flaky and fresh. All in all, I enjoyed it greatly but still was left not entirely satisfied. Now one thing that was quite satisfying would have to be their happy hour. Shoot, any place that serves up some decent prices from 3:30-9:00PM Mon-Thur is a damn good location in my book. They shorten it up to \"normal\" happy hour times for the weekend, but stop by when you can as the fish \\'n\\' chips were a mere $7. Not too shabby. Plus they were able to accommodate seating for a group of 12ish well, even splitting up the bill. Cheers to that!'}, {'review_id': 'wR6Z9fBJndXmTQ4ceOigLw', 'business_id': 'gP921Ghfb7ERWmOjl7r-ng', 'user_id': 'tYD-v5M_3mfKVe5-xesKmw', 'date': '2009-06-17', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"I've been back twice, once as tour guide to happy hour out of town friends, and again for the book club.

I really like sitting outside on their dock, but I always wish I had a boat so I could pull up and tie up right alongside, as they have moorage available for customers that arrive by watercraft.\"}, {'review_id': '6kfg4NIo20F16YWNF9hI7A', 'business_id': 'gP921Ghfb7ERWmOjl7r-ng', 'user_id': '99MpqrGNjmP028ng_C-8HQ', 'date': '2009-09-10', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': 'I\\'m not really sure WHY a place with an amazing view and a very competent staff decided to have a great happy hour 7 days a week where you can get 2 alcoholic drinks, 1 non-alcoholic drink, 2 meals and an appetizer for around $30, but I am glad they did . . .

I have never been so disappointed in a birthday meal. Even when i was 6 years old &amp; throwing up I had a better time then I had here.Happy hours have extended so they are until close in the bar. Cool. Prices have gone up. Not cool. We picked out a variety of concoctions, and granted, our choices were weird. Pulled pork sliders, egg rolls, fish &amp; chips, &amp; oyster shooters. &#160;Decent selection of beers &amp; drinks with 16 oz beer for $3.50 on happy hour. I pick Big E and am deeply disappointed that it tastes like I am snorting cigarettes. I have never sent back a beer but I just couldn't do it. Sad face.The only thing even passable is the fish &amp; chips (great fries &amp; tartar) but pretty skimpy for the happy hour price of $7. Everything else- we ate half our meal &amp; left hungry. No sauce on the pulled pork (besides a big red A that our waiter gleeful told us stood for her name)- travesty. Shooters can look unappetizing &amp; these just look flacid. Eggs rolls were just an odd choice. I will take the fault for those.The waitress may have noticed our unhappiness with our meal if she had brought out our meal, checked on our status or cleared our plates. She was noticably absent as all of her 2 tables had to catch her to order another drink, get the bill, and have her run the card. As former waiters, lazy waitstaff makes us angry and we hate seeing the busser working hard for her to spoil the tip. Plus- they were unprofessional yelling to each other from across the bar &amp; talking about tips. Bad service.We have happy memories of drunken happy hours here, but this was the worst happy hour I have been to ever. And on my birthday.

The fish was great, but grilling does not lend a lot of nuance.

There are definitely other places a bit further towards the University of Washington campus where you could find a more decently sized meal for the same amount.

- found it excellent.Since it\\'s halibut season, I ordered the wild halibut (with fingerling potatoes, asparagus, bacon, and a lemon sauce) and my boyfriend\\'s dad ordered the grilled halibut (with Swiss chard and squash) - but here\\'s the kicker, see. &#160;Aforementioned boyfriend is a vegetarian, and one of those poor long-suffering souls who get to grin and bear it whenever popular opinion chooses a restaurant where he can\\'t get much aside from a vegetarian platter, which is what he ordered. &#160;What he received was an array of roasted tomatoes, asparagus, zucchini, and what he described as the best portabello mushroom he\\'d ever eaten - along with a serving of fresh goat cheese. &#160;Even the dish considered by many restaurants to be a \"throwaway\" sort of platter received the same consideration and care as one of their more formal seafood dishes.This is what I love about Ivar\\'s right here: not only is everything cooked to perfection (not underdone or overcooked to obliterated flakyness), but the other elements of the meal don\\'t feel like side dishes or afterthoughts: they are fully incorporated into the taste of the dish. &#160;The smoky, savory nature of the bacon infused itself into the halibut, as did the asparagus - the fish flavor was of course paramount, but everything worked together as a solid whole - it was reported by boyfriend\\'s dad (I need to come up with an acronym for him so I don\\'t have to keep retyping that - BD or such) that his meal shared the same cohesive \"everything works together\" properties. &#160;I\\'m not a chef, but squash with something as light as halibut - I\\'ve never have figured. &#160;But DANG it was tasty.I apologize heartily if anyone ran into a bad experience at Ivar\\'s, because everything I ran into there - from the exceptional beers ON TAP (try Rogue\\'s Deadliest Ale!) to the consistent and considerate service - was excellent. &#160;Their prices are in the higher range of places to eat, but while at other places I look at the bill and wince, I look at my Ivar\\'s bill and nod like \"yeah - so worth it.\"[GENERAL COMMENT NOT REALLY HAVING TO DO WITH THE FOOD: if you go to Ivar\\'s, seriously, dress the **** up. &#160;It\\'s not Chili\\'s for crap\\'s sake, put on a nice jacket or shirt. &#160;If you don\\'t, you look so out of place in that beautiful cedar-wood nicely-lit atmosphere. &#160;If you stick to the bar, fine, but my god if you go out to eat at a nice place WEAR DECENT PANTS FOR THE LOVE OF CRAP. &#160;Rant over!]'}, {'review_id': 'cYpZ8Y30HNbQeChje2K3lg', 'business_id': 'gP921Ghfb7ERWmOjl7r-ng', 'user_id': '_SjOxIOHJlQ-lrombsPx5Q', 'date': '2009-06-08', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': 'I love the location...watching the boats..the tourist...the seagulls...the freeway above...the space needle off to the south...I would bring trent reznor and kate winslet here...they would enjoy the fish and chips..we would talk about the breeze...I would order more wine...we would laugh.A wonderful spot..that I dont spend nearly enough time at...plenty of parking nearby...gas works park..if you want to get something to go...nice job ivars'}, {'review_id': 'xB6Byj8CWYZx7LF3wOXYxw', 'business_id': 'gP921Ghfb7ERWmOjl7r-ng', 'user_id': 'v07K-Mq5-uBmIuNuXL4KMg', 'date': '2008-11-30', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"This is a reverse review, if you will.

Moving on...)For beverages, I had a Winter Margarita which was a warm tequila concoction served in a brandy snifter. It was more tepid than warm but really delish, and Chris had a good ole Mack and Jack.Overall, it was a wonderful meal capped off with a view of the Christmas Ships heading out (although it wasn't even December yet).

We munched on the shrimp and fish and chips first and both were tasty and cooked perfectly and hot, I like hot food. Then there was the salad. We started eating and after a few bites each realized the salmon was completely raw throughout, like it had barely been seared. We kind of picked it apart to see if we could eat around it but it was all raw so we told the waiter and he said no problem, he'd get us another. 15 minutes later, we got our salad back, that is, the same salad with the salmon we had picked apart. Now, I'm no expert, but wouldn't recooking already picked at, eaten salmon be some kind of health hazard? Wouldn't they just have gotten us a new one? Hmmm, I guess not. We ate it and the salad was good, very average, nothing special, but not bad. I like this place for HH because they have more food to choose from than most HHs and they have extended hours.

Several items seemed like creative ways to dispose of masses of leftover, unwanted smoked salmon. &#160;Some items were very oddly flavored - like some delicious- LOOKING flank steak that tasted kind of like solvent (did they run out of lighter fluid for the grill?), and a frittata-item that just tasted weird and bland. &#160;The raw oysters were good, if you don't mind them rather shredded. &#160;The shrimp were watery and lacked flavor. &#160;I think the biggest disappointment was the lack of nice vegetables - Acres of Clams always did a nice platter of roasted vegetables - and also the fact that the regular fish n chips like you'd get in the seafood bars, was HARD and DRY. &#160;LAME!!! &#160;Oh, and with all the salmon on display, poorly prepared (rock-hard, badly flavored 'teriyaki' salmon comes to mind) and with, again, weird off-putting flavors, would it be that hard to have a plate of nice simple lox and bagels? &#160;I thought brunch places want you to eat bread to fill up? &#160;Apparently not Ivar's. &#160;We found some bagels, but they were HARD AS ROCKS and there was NO cream cheese anywhere, OR lox. &#160;The dessert bar was OK, but a couple items tasted old and were also rock-hard, like the baklava. &#160;Truly horrible. &#160;Tasted like it'd been made long ago. &#160;Seriously, I have never seen us send so many plates away with lots of uneaten food on them - and there were several bites that I spit out and concealed, just too icky to swallow. &#160;I was so pissed. &#160;Had we not been there for an occasion, I would have walked out. &#160;We manage to get the three of us together about 2 or 3 times a year, and Ivar's ruined our day. &#160;Thanks for nothing, Ivar's. &#160;You've not only lost us for any brunch occasion, but I will probably never go to Ivar's again, except occasional fish n chips for my son at the seafood bars. &#160;The waiter was sweet - but he could see that we weren't happy, and that things were stale and substandard, and I even saw him talking to a manager after we told him about the bagels, and no one came and talked to us or said anything. &#160;I really don't think they care. Never, ever again.Oh, and one more thing - the Bloody Mary's are $5 now, but they also charge for the non-alcoholic drinks that used to be included. &#160;Not a big deal, but FYI.Actually, why I'm bothering to share that I don't know. &#160;If you're going there after reading this, I don't know why you use Yelp at all.\"}, {'review_id': 'gUHcOtpvY6YENL61du8Q5w', 'business_id': 'gP921Ghfb7ERWmOjl7r-ng', 'user_id': '48TcWpBKHe2xSDCu_H8SKg', 'date': '2012-10-03', 'stars': 5.0, 'text': 'Amazing food.

Absolutely unheard of and a real gem to have fairly close to your neighborhood.The ambiance is always nice and relaxing and even though the decor is a little tired and feeling a bit more 80's than 2011, the lights off the water in the evening are always a nice backdrop for some great eats and drink.Don't let me forget the service. One stand-out server that's taken care of us on multiple occasions was a girl named Ari, but pretty much every visit we're greeted and taken care of by someone that knows what they are doing and does it well. It's highly appreciated by 2 people in the industry. It's nice when people in service actually care enough to treat their guests as they would want to be treated.Kudos to Ivar's Salmon House for the efforts in creating a great Happy Hour menu and atmosphere that is sure to keep 'em piling through the door!\"}, {'review_id': 'tteN7kEj6PIlAQ3I4vXN0w', 'business_id': 'gP921Ghfb7ERWmOjl7r-ng', 'user_id': 'pD4c0eVE0ImAgcag4w4-lA', 'date': '2011-09-19', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': \"Ivar's is a chain seafood restaurant in Seattle and Ivar's Salmon House has good eats and a great view. &#160;The oysters are quite fresh though could be cleaned a little more thoroughly. &#160;The clam chowder was good but pales in comparison to Pike's Place Chowder at the public market. &#160;The fried platter was decent though I expected tastier and more succulent pieces of shrimp.\"}, {'review_id': '5t7sxfqMaOxuitOSqzYJcg', 'business_id': 'gP921Ghfb7ERWmOjl7r-ng', 'user_id': 'JO9CPEwBjV3UJuIOgs8Zzw', 'date': '2011-11-02', 'stars': 2.0, 'text': \"I was expecting much more from Ivar's.

It goes from 9:30am - 2:00pm every Sunday, reservations are a good idea because it can get crowded. The food is amazing. There is a huge of variety and everything is delicious. You can get seafood such as crab legs, oysters on the half shell, ceviche, salmon and shrimp. There are also different kinds of pasta, salad, cheese, meats, and breakfast items such as eggs benedict, sausage, bacon and hash browns.

When the day is exhausted and a venture to Mt Rainier is out of the question, a meal at an old stalwarts like Ivar\\'s Salmon House comes to mind. Nothing defines the Pacific Northwest more than rain and salmon. The decor is typical of any \\'traditional\\' Seattle restaurant; that is, Native American art, cedar architecture, totem poles, and the requisite Orca whale painting. While to the average resident these designs are typical and expected, an out-of-towner would find delight in the peculiarities that we found so common. In that sense, Ivar\\'s \"works\".The south end of the restaurant has huge bay windows that overlooks Lake Union and the I-5 bridge. Sit there and dine next to the Seattle skyline. As for the food, since I try to avoid most of that farmed pseudo-salmon out east, whenever I come home, I make it a point to fill up on delicious wild salmon. But first, we ordered a bottle of 2005 Jacob\\'s Creek Shiraz ($26) (man.. can the Aussie\\'s make shiraz!) - dark garnet, tannic, medium bodied with notes of dark fruits (dried plums, tobacco), alcohol level in check, and a nice mouthwatering backbone. To whet our appetites, we requested the famous Ivar\\'s Clam Chowder ($4.50). It was good, but not fantastic. A few more clams and a richer (versus creamier) soup would have been fantastic. Though, I admit I was nearly full from the cup of soup by itself. I did find the Seafood Chowder ($4.50) to be more flavorful, so I\\'ll probably get that next time. Now, we ordered for a group of 12, two plates of Family Style Alder Grilled Sockeye Patter ($60), which came with a side of mashed potatoes and vegetables, and an order of 5oz Alder Grilled Wild Alaskan Halibut ($22)*. I certainly hope it wasn\\'t the long anticipation nor the high hopes, but I found the Sockeye to be just ok, perhaps I\\'m simply not a fan of Alder grilling. Salmon is usually rich and buttery and oh-so-savory. With Ivar\\'s, the alder seemed to impart an unfavorable smoky taste and more salt than is necessary. The flesh wasn\\'t dry, but it also wasn\\'t as moist as salmon can be. For $60 at 2 pounds (half the salmon), I don\\'t expect anything less than top notch preparation. As for the sides, the mashed potatoes were fine, not mind-blowing. I would venture that it was overly machine mashed, as the texture was, for lack of a better description, cafeteria-style. I\\'d expect the boiled potatoes milled through a ricer would produce a more pillowy dish. The vegetables turned out to be steamed spinach. They were good; favorites of the table actually. However, a plate of salmon (soft) and a plate of mashed potatoes (soft) does not equate to another soft dish. A mix of vegetables or some textural change would have been so very much appreciated. Other than the oyster crackers in my chowder, nothing had a satisfying crunch! Service was as expected, present but not hovering. Although when the restaurant is empty, put at least a one table seating buffer with the next group to be seated. Go for the view and the novelty.*I didn\\'t have any halibut, so I can\\'t comment on it.review 12/30/2008I.M.Y.'}, {'review_id': 'r6SqZtpM5HTfuntg6T7zNg', 'business_id': 'gP921Ghfb7ERWmOjl7r-ng', 'user_id': '3Hj_Me3C_yoYOBwWGGB9Ew', 'date': '2011-07-11', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"Pretty good but kind of pricey.

Seriously?!?!I have been here for Happy Hour, lunch &amp; dinner.

Food... mind as well do lunch at the to go bar.These visits have been over the past 3 years - most recently, this summer, we came via dock - which was nice to pull up the boat and be right there for dinner.We wanted to eat outside, but were told there would be a 20 minute wait for 4; there were at least 4 empty tables we noticed were empty when the hostess (after a cool greeting from an icy hostess in front who directed us to the back) told us there were 2 groups in front of us; when my friends husband pointed this out, we were met with a blank stare. After more confusion, we decided to eat in the bar area. Feeling the summer atmosphere, I wanted a good white wine with dinner - their less than impressive selection (well, what could I expect??) and of course they were out of the wine I wanted. I decided on a recommendation from the waiter - and then waited a good 15 minutes for it to arrive after everyone else had their beers (also note - they don't do pitchers of beer). I had to ask, and was met with another blank stare from our new waiter. &#160;He had such an indifferent attitude towards serving us all night, I wondered if he would feel the same way about a tip that reflected that service. When my $20 salmon (disappointing salmon at a salmon house- really?!?) arrived in a tiny bowl in a forgettable sauce (which sounded like it came with a salad from the menu's description) I knew I really didn't need to return.

We got there just in time for the end of the happy hour and the waitress got us our food right away, though I was a little disappointed that she didn't offer us any tea.

They seem to have a good variety of fish outside of the usual tuna/salmon/albacore/yellowtail gang, so I'll come back to try again.\"}, {'review_id': 'kZhyHoyJDiHQ-TPlL5xztg', 'business_id': 'WwAan2HA-sPa6pAv6YSriA', 'user_id': 'qlna7MEKYpiiiWnu9pF48Q', 'date': '2010-07-08', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': 'I love sushi, I took my mom here last weekend.'}, {'review_id': 'X1FKbOnA7fHg0-FMm3VQ7A', 'business_id': 'WwAan2HA-sPa6pAv6YSriA', 'user_id': 'fsZH62bMz8raLzA3_BfkHg', 'date': '2010-08-01', 'stars': 5.0, 'text': \"Best sushi I have ever had.

It was all pretty tasty.Even raw scallops, that I'm typically wary of, were served betwixt slices of lemon which added a citrusy bite that complemented the sweet sweet flesh. I fell in love with mackerel again. Chutoro had too much sinew eaten raw, but the torched one melted on your tongue with charred butteriness. The sushi chef read my mind (or heard my mumblings) at least a couple times, which was delightful. His selections were all pretty straightfoward: sashimi plate, duo of salmon, dual prep of chutoro, uni, etc. His one venture into the experimental was pretty creepy for the inexperienced.He served up raw sweet shrimp squirted with flavorful tonics and topped with a single raw egg yolk. Now, I'm not a huge fan of mushy sweet shrimp but the texture of the egg yolk prevented me from focusing on it. I really had to distract my brain from analyzing what I was eating at all levels (origin, taste, texture, smell).I was relieved that he served up the fried shrimp heads right after. Love that crispy antennae! I was emboldened by the egg yolk and devoured the whole shrimp head instead of gingerly avoiding the brainy part.We were pretty full and tipsy on hot sake but we needed $4 more to meet the $50 quota for our certificate, so we ended the night with an order of oyster shooters.

Anyways, I\\'m trying to eat at one new place every day, or at least every time i eat out, and tonight that led me to I Love Sushi.Upon entering i was greeted by the chefs, then greeted/seated by the hostess. Good so far, everyone seems nice! I usually look for signs to see who owns and runs the restaurant. Not trying to be a food snob or anything but i really value originality. I\\'m glad this is a Japanese owned Japanese run sushi place. I took a glance at the menu and noticed that, a few appetizers aside, they really only have sushi (hence the name i guess) but I\\'m used to sushi places also having quite diverse menus.I ordered the Mt. Rainer (or w/e it was called), and a kirin draft (SO glad they had this) and the meal was great! all the fish were extremely fresh. They also use real crab meat in their california rolls.During my meal, i spoke with 2 of the sushi chefs. One of them was more reserved and didn\\'t seem to want to talk, so i talked to the other one. He was curious as to why there were so many teriyaki restaurants. He didn\\'t understand why americans liked that so much. I\\'m not sure myself, but it sure was disappointing to see most of the \"japanese\" restaurants serving that. I asked him where i could eat yakitori, he could only name 1 restaurant. Side note: From my experience, here are a large number of Korean owned/run \"Japanese\" restaurants all over Seattle.He said they tried serving sukiyaki, but stopped due to the lack of demand from Seattle. So they went back to pure sushi.He also said he misses eating okonomiyaki, and hanging out in shinjuku. I guess i shouldn\\'t have brought up my trip to japan. Now he wants to go back to visit.Anyways, bottom line is the place has nice and fresh sushi.

Since Yelp does not have any explanation of the star system in their review guidelines, I am creating my own. For me a three star rating means the restaurant was overall good and that I was not displeased with the experience and that I would probably eat there again but that there might be other places that offer the same style food or service which I might prefer. I will be reserving four stars for restaurants which I feel to be of overall excellent quality and five stars for truly incredible experiences.That explanation out of the way on to the review. I found I Love Sushi's Lake Union shop to have a pleasing atmosphere with a nice view of lake and a friendly and attentive staff. The waitress kept the drinks full, the plates cleared, and the orders coming without being too interruptive and the sushi chef prepared and served very fresh fish in attractive presentations. Their current specials menu included Madai, Aji, and Chutoro which were all excellent. I also recommend the bacon wrapped oysters from the cooked specials - two of my very favorite foods combined into one excellent dish.Now for the things that kept me from giving them a four star rating: Compared to the Bellevue location the menu the menu is fairly Americanized. Beyond sushi, sashimi and makimono ( rolls ) they offer a small selection of Teriyaki style entrees and a handful of cooked appetizers plus Miso and Edamame make up the appetizer menu. Whereas the Bellevue location has a much more extensive menu of Japanese style cooked entrees appetizers and small plate dishes ( the matsutake dobinmushi was especially wonderful last time I was there ) as well as a selection of dishes featuring organic tofu.The large size of the sushi and sashimi. This is one of my frequent complaints about sushi restaurants. Sushi is supposed to be bite sized yet so frequently sushi restaurants serve pieces of nigiri sushi that are large enough that they are either difficult to chew or need to be cut in half ( and I am by no means a small person or delicate eater). It is also fairly common to see extra thick slices of sashimi that can barely be supported by the thin sliced daikon used to prop them up on the plate. To be fair the chefs at I Love Sushi - Lake Union weren't as bad about this as some I have seen but I still thought it was a bit large.Lastly, it is a bit pricey, even for sushi. The sushi, sashimi, and specialty rolls are all a little on the high side compared to restaurants of similar quality and I was amazed to see that they are charging $16 a glass of the Onikoroshi when I know several places where this can be had for under $10 a glass. So, while all in all enjoyable, there were a few things that put me off and I would recommend that when you are in the mood for this high quality sushi and willing to pay these prices, take the extra time to drive across the lake and visit the flagship location in Bellevue.\"}, {'review_id': 'HZxfVHN14yccuF_xkl3PEQ', 'business_id': 'WwAan2HA-sPa6pAv6YSriA', 'user_id': 'R15bbL8vNMvnseSB3FrCpA', 'date': '2008-06-26', 'stars': 2.0, 'text': \"I was excited to eat here after being told it was one of Seattle's best sushi restaurants. &#160;Boy, was I disappointed. &#160;This is decent sushi at best. &#160;The restuarant is stuffy and dark, and the fish is nothing special. &#160;The nigiri sushi was decent, but the rolls had far too much rice. &#160;This was only slightly better than grocery store sushi. &#160;You can do much, much better in Seattle.The waitress was terrible. &#160;She didn't refill the water glasses once during an hour-long meal (or return to ask how everything was, if we wanted anything else, etc). &#160;When she brought our food, she gave the wrong dishes to the wrong people, then argued with us when we told her she had the names of the sushi combos wrong. &#160;We challenged her to bring the menu, and it turned out we were right. &#160;Then she ignored us. &#160;Sorry?The only thing I enjoyed was sitting outside on lake union. &#160;But I wouldn't return even for that.\"}, {'review_id': 'iTQGAHa-QM2_iftvdveAyA', 'business_id': 'WwAan2HA-sPa6pAv6YSriA', 'user_id': 'TUzdqtQpOgl_zXMp-trgXw', 'date': '2009-10-15', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"I love sushi, yes I do!

Maybe when he was a sushi apprentice, the master sushi chef saw him doing a shoddy job and taught him a permanent lesson? Or maybe it was a vengeful former girlfriend who couldn\\'t stand to see him succeed as a sushi chef and so she pulled a Lorena Bobbitt on his hand?

So I took a gamble when we needed a VIP sushi outing for work. Happily, the gamble paid off! Appropriate for a fish-filled cuisine, I think I could hear purring from all seated at the table.One pleasing development since my last visit is the addition of outdoor seating. There's an awning over top to protect you from sun, and glass sides so you can sit close to the boats docked at the marina without being splashed. Outside's definitely the place to be for lunch seating on a warm sunny day! &#160;With a crisp white wine chilled at the table, it felt like a 2-hour mini vacation by the lake.Next, I must tell you about an appetizer that's easy to miss but insanely good. It's just called Spicy Tofu, but the exquisitely fried tofu cubes melt in your mouth and the sauce they float in - a garlicky tomato broth with radish sprouts - is piquant and just utterly divine. Non-tofu folks love it too, promise! I've seen them lap it up. Also in the soy category, the edamame (young green soybeans) were boiled and salted to perfection.Other good appetizers are the summer rolls on special. This time, we had sushi grade salmon, asparagus, crisp lettuce and soft rice noodles wrapped up in soft rice paper wrappers served with dipping sauce. It felt like spa cuisine, light and summery and healthy. That almost made up for the insane amount of sushi that was yet to come.For the main showdown, we tackled a boat-load of sushi. Restraint was not in this group's vocabulary, but that does mean I can vouch for a large number of specialty rolls as well as the pure quality of the nigiri.Paradise Roll is a fairly new item, I think, and one of the biggest hits at our table. It contained salmon, tuna, yellow tail and spicy sauce, each piece mounded with flying fish roe in either orange, yellow or green. The Marin roll had fish (I've lost track of what kind), avocado, yummy cream cheese and it rolled a little smaller so it was easier to eat. The Spicy Tuna roll was indeed quite spicy and everyone loved how many crunchy tempura bits were dusted atop the outside of the Crunchy Roll. I guess the names are accurate! As for nigiri, we loved the Spanish mackerel, super white tuna, sockeye and king salmon. All had fresh, clean flavors. My advice is just to order a bunch of things and share them around the table. You'll find a mix of familiar favorites and new twists. The server, by the way, handled our insatiable sushi appetite well. She always had the next item out just as we were ready for more, never having too many plates to squeeze onto the table at one time yet never leaving us hungry awaiting the next course.The price range will vary based on how much sushi you order. Our bill was quite spendy but then we showed absolutely no signs of restraint.

My share was about $30 worth of food. &#160;The place is quite pricey, but you get your money\\'s worth. &#160;Oh, and you have to pay for parking if you plan to park in the lot right in front of the restaurant, too. &#160;The service is not bad although it can get quite busy. &#160;A lot of their customers seemed to dress more business casual here. &#160;The tea they serve is genmaicha, which is sooo much better than your average green tea! &#160;Also, I feel like this is one of those restaurants where they make an effort to work on the presentation of their food, and that always makes the food more appealing.I still prefer Sushi Land just because my standards aren\\'t that high for sushi and I love cheap food a lot more, but if you\\'re looking for a great place with a great view to take your raw-fish-loving date, this is not a bad choice at all. &#160;Just don\\'t expect her to wear some sexy lingerie for you that night because she\\'ll probably fall into a food coma afterwards and sleep in flannel pajamas instead...not speaking from experience at all.'}, {'review_id': '0gN0LSQAznZaqHtrzELuxQ', 'business_id': 'WwAan2HA-sPa6pAv6YSriA', 'user_id': 'Zt1Zs23ifbxTCDhvH46pBA', 'date': '2011-04-06', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': \"We came here for happy hour/dinner and enjoyed our food for the most part, but definitely didn't leave raving about the place.1.

I Love Sushi used to be my favorite sushi spot in Seattle. But I've noticed that the last few times I've been here, it has really declined in both quality of food and service. Last July, I came here with my groomsmen as a kick off dinner to my bachelor party. The service was terrible in so many ways: We didn't get a menu for at least 20 minutes, the servers hardly knew their own menu, it took forever to get our order and food, and longer still to figure out our check. Also, when handed an assortment of raw fish, whether it's a variety of nigiri or a sushi plate such as the sashimi dinner or chirashi sushi, any good sushi waiter is supposed to explain and showcase each cut of fish that was just set down in front of you. Our waitress hastily plopped it down and ran off. When asking what cuts of fish I had when she returned, not only did she not have a clue, but she was absolutely horrified that I had asked her anything at all. Again, what happened to this place? Despite the bad service last July, I still felt that the food was still on par to the high quality that I am used to from I Love Sushi, until yesterday. The service kicked off pretty bad as they sat us in a table that had soy sauce smeared all over the table, menus, and chairs. When our food finally came, I felt that the cuts of fish on the nigiri were not fresh and even kind of dry around the edges. The size of the paradise roll I ordered is probably half the size of what I remember them being. My wife's Cod dinner was a few pieces of glazed cod sloppily plopped onto wilted pieces of lettuce. I'd expect this kind of dish for 15-20 bucks, but for a whopping $29 dollars, you would expect a higher quality dish.What used to have great food, outstanding service, and even a farewell good bye and thank you from the entire staff, I Love Sushi has really declined in the last couple years. &#160;As a food blogger, I try to avoid negative writing on restaurants and small businesses. instead, I try to write about places that I really believe in where people will more than likely be impressed by whatever it is that that small business or restaurant sells. I'm writing this entry simply because I used to believe that this restaurant used to be one of those places I believed in. But now I'm afraid that I probably will never come here again. -Francishttp://www.francisfoodie&#8230;\"}, {'review_id': '-ilUnKzxI6r1bNrZ6usfiQ', 'business_id': 'WwAan2HA-sPa6pAv6YSriA', 'user_id': 'NDPQ1NoGRlJl2pA-yh7u3w', 'date': '2007-05-09', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"I like sushi, and have eaten at the many of the raved-about places in town, from that humble little Wallingford eatery with the seemingly perpetual wait, to the upscale establishments in Belltown and the Madison Valley where you seem to wait just as long (in fairness, unlike the Wallingford place, they do accept reservations). And also the conveyor belt places. And the places that serve large numbers of tempura'ed rolls. I'll even admit to eating at the all-you-can-eat places, both ongoing and since defunct. One of my all-time faves is I Love Sushi - the Lake Union location. While this place has been around a while. It maintains its clean, simple interior where every seat in the house has a line of sight to the long sushi bar. The service is consistently good; they're polite, never make you wait too long, and they're there when you need them. And your orders are always prepared in good time. I like the sushi because it's always fresh, has good flavor, and goes down smooooth. I've had the opportunity to try various kinds of sashimi, individual sushi and roll orders, combinations like chirashi, and the larger combo platters.

Why? Because of all the places we've tried in Seattle (since we moved here in April), this one is the one we've returned to the most times.The reason we keep coming back: the fantastic lunch deal on the bento box. It is a TON of food. Like, don't even think about trying to eat it all unless you are starving. At $12.95, it's the best and most plentiful meal we've found anywhere. We only go here when we haven't eaten breakfast and really want something substantial, but then it is fabulous. A little bit of everything -- sashimi, a roll, veggie tempura, salads, pickles, soup, their delicious barbecued salmon, tea, rice, etc. The salad and tempura are the best. The sashimi is always good. We've ordered rolls here, as well as at their South Lake Union location, and didn't care for them -- *way* too large to eat easily, and just not that great in terms of flavors (although the fish is tasty). So, my advice is to order the bento if you're starving (did I mention $12.95?? I've never yet had to eat dinner after eating this for lunch), or order sashimi if you want something lighter. The sashimi is not spectacular, but it's usually a good deal and fresh. The exception to this: the first time I came here, a couple of years ago, I had the abalone sashimi and it was divine. Also, the service is always fast and attentive.\"}, {'review_id': 'L0HTYG-MGEY3u5zNidjcRg', 'business_id': 'WwAan2HA-sPa6pAv6YSriA', 'user_id': '82l3OuDkPJk8NKnrb9LkYg', 'date': '2012-01-09', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"We wanted to have our favorite sushi before we went to our dinner cruise on New Years Eve. &#160;Unfortunately, Fuji Sushi didn't open until 5:00 p.m. and we knew that would cut it close and we wouldn't be able to pig out for dinner. &#160;After much scrutiny from my sushi king, we decided to go to I Love Sushi in Lake Union. &#160;We got a nice seat close to the window and proceeded to look over the menu for drinks and our sushi desires. &#160;We always get a rainbow roll because that's our favorite and then choose a few others. &#160;I usually will order something spicy (he can't eat spicy) and then we decide on something else we can share. &#160;This time, we got the rainbow, dragon and Seattle rolls with an appetizer of the vegetable tempura. &#160;Our drinks came out (him his usual sake and me my ever present martini) and we pounced on the vegetable tempura. &#160;It was fried so well and consisted of eggplant, onion, carrot and beans. &#160;Yummo!Finally, our rolls arrived and they were really good. &#160;Of course, it's not Fuji but it came really close. &#160;All of the ingredients were fresh and tasted delicious. &#160;The avocado was nice and green and soft and the fish melted in your mouth.The prices are pretty standard depending on the roll. &#160;Rainbow of course being the most expensive at a little more than $12, but like the old adage you get what you pay for and it worth going back when we are in the area and Fuji is not open.\"}, {'review_id': 'vKCV-JzF1_7zjlk1vWTdIw', 'business_id': 'WwAan2HA-sPa6pAv6YSriA', 'user_id': 'HFCRM3EKyplFO5MbFk7rng', 'date': '2011-09-27', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': 'Our first date night in Seattle brought us to I Love Sushi.

Otherwise, there\\'s simply not enough space to accommodate a last-minute party of 6 or more.'}, {'review_id': '9hpWTuYm1O2wUVSR2UPa5w', 'business_id': 'WwAan2HA-sPa6pAv6YSriA', 'user_id': '9Ru1xYB0eI8nQlITzb175A', 'date': '2010-12-17', 'stars': 5.0, 'text': 'I am so amused by some of the reviews on here....

Honestly? *shakes head*3) If you haven\\'t gone to I Love Sushi and ordered a chef choice sushi/sashimi platter, you are missing out.

So a couple weeks a I asked a store I was giving a presentation too in the Rainier area what they wanted for lunch. They all said JONES BBQ emphatically . So I ordered the team a spread from the restaurant. It smelled so good and everyone was loving it so much but, since I was speaking I could not try any of it. Since then I was craving the place so bad and really wanted to try the ribs.  I brought &#160;a co worker from Korea with me so I could show him American good BBQ. When we ordered I found out they would not have ribs for a half hour and was really disappointed. But, I was ok with getting the chopped pork sandwich meal.  I sat down with my Pork Sandwich and mac salad and it was great!! Then 20 minutes into the meal one of the owners stopped by the table and brought a slab of ribs to my table because he knew I came here for the ribs. I was blown away by the gesture and rightfully blown away by the ribs. SO GOOD!! Falling off the bone with that delicious caramelized burn crust on the outside. WOW! Best bbq I have had in Seattle and probably the best I can ever remember including the ones I have had in Texas and Vegas.

&#160;Well, this is the standard by which all others shall be measured. &#160;I had the beef brisket and chicken combo. &#160;It is clear that both meats had been carefully prepared using the 'low-and-slow' BBQ methodology of low heat and long cooking time. &#160;The brisket was juicy and tender, bursting with smokey, beefy flavor. &#160;The chicken was also saturated with smokey goodness, and not at all dry, not even the breast meat, which is frequently dried out by less skilled pit cooks. &#160;The beans are a treat as well, with just the right degree of mustardy/vinegary tang.BBQ isn't cheap food; When you consider what a time-consuming proposition making good BBQ is, it's clear that you're paying for quality ingredients + time, and more time! &#160;The 2-meat (choice of chicken, ribs, hot links, brisket, small ends) dinner is $20, but you get enough food to feed two normal appetites.They make their own sauce, and do believe the sign that warns that the medium-hot BBQ sauce is spicy. &#160;I like spicy food, and I was really surprised how spicy-hot the medium was. &#160;Nothing I couldn't handle, though, and it was a pitch-perfect balance of sweet and heat. &#160;I suggest most folks go with mild. &#160;I suspect their 'spicy' sauce would kick the butt of 'The Man' (the ridiculous sauce they serve at Dixies BBQ in Blah-vue. &#160;Any moron can make a hot sauce; just add enough pepper. &#160;But making a spicy sauce that still TASTES good is a whole 'nother song to dance to, son. &#160;But the dilletante Bellevue yuppie crowd wouldn't know the difference, so they can have it).Another nice detail is how they wrap the 'to-go' boxes in shrink wrap as one more guard to ensure that the sauce doesn't leak out all over your car. &#160;I appreciate little details like this. &#160;Did I mention that Jones BBQ loves their customers?Anyway, this is the best BBQ in Seattle. &#160;Get in there!!!\"}, {'review_id': '0tYCRp_Kkf1F1bS2rm0FUg', 'business_id': 'tC3J0kq_T-7ZINOJPSTWlA', 'user_id': 'G-AeXuKhGkz09aA020IXHg', 'date': '2013-02-05', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': \"I decided to try Jones today. &#160;First of all, the lady who took my order was a B***h. &#160;Extremely rude. &#160;I should have immediately turned around and made a quick exit, but I overlooked her attitude and decided to buy a rack of ribs to go. &#160;What a waste of money. &#160;About 1/4 of the ribs were overcooked or I should say burned on one side. &#160;They tried to cover the burn up by placing these ribs at the bottom of the container with the expectation that I either wouldn't notice the burn or perhaps they assumed the sauce would save the ribs. &#160;The other ribs were below average and clearly not cooked by someone who takes pride in their product. &#160;My wife and I are extremely disappointed and I will NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER return to this place.\"}, {'review_id': 'cCBIjEsSStDRsG_shUG5nQ', 'business_id': 'tC3J0kq_T-7ZINOJPSTWlA', 'user_id': 'f7V3d269Y0QsKVxRnBdFfg', 'date': '2013-01-18', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': \"I received horrible service when I visited Jone's BBQ the last time.

Would have been ideal if this didn't happen, but I can understand their situation.I came back the following Tuesday (after groupon expired), and explained the situation. They honored the groupon without trouble, which made me feel really warm and squishy inside.And, the food was GOOD. We got the 2 way combo with beans and coleslaw, extra side mac and cheese, extra corn bread, with the hot sauce. The chicken and brisket were really good. The coleslaw was light (not heavy on the mayo) and crisp, a nice side to bring the heat down. Beans and mac n cheese were both really good, as was the cornbread. I could have done without the plain toast - maybe this is authentic or something, but it did nothing for me. That's OK, I can just ignore it and enjoy everything else.The hot sauce was hot. Not hot enough to make us cry or sweat. Enough that we need to have a bite of something mild or a sip of coke here and there. Just right!The setting was fine, I found it comfortable and homey.

Oddly enough they insisted on eating BBQ and I heard that Jones BBQ had good BBQ food so that is the ONLY reason I stuck with them and didn\\'t go with someone else. I began trying to reach the company (via phone) nearly two weeks prior to the day of my catered event. I called one of the restaurants/stores and was told the person who manages the catering \"dept\" (Lashey) only returned calls after business hours and turns out the \"catering\" phone # is a home phone and Lashey works a full-time job elsewhere (red flag). Left several VM\\'s and FINALLY TWO DAYS BEFORE MY EVENT Lashey calls back apologizing for not returning my calls sooner. Apparently there was a family emergency but it was supposedly \\'taken care of\" and I was very sympathetic, offering to cancel my order if it was going to be too burdensome during the \"family crisis\". I was assured over and over there would not be a problem fulfilling the order. Food was to be delivered NO LATER THAN 11:00 am on event day. Well, 11:00 rolled around - no food. 11:15 came and went - no food. By 11:30 there was no food AND NO phone call or email letting me know where the food was. I called the store but no one knew anything about this order and had no phone number to reach Lashey (at her regular job). I emailed her, called her - no response. FINALLY got a call from the delivery driver at 11:45 am saying he was \"on his way\". He shows up at 12:15 pm - OVER AN HOUR LATE and apologized profusely and then tells me that the order was missing one of the side dishes. &#160;OMG! SERIOUSLY?????Several of the Board members had to get to the airport and couldn\\'t wait for the food to arrive so they left without lunch - NOT GOOD! &#160;Not once did Lashey ever initiate follow-up communication from me. I had to call HER every time and since then, Lashey promised that the owner of Jones would personally call me to apologize but he never did and she never bothered to do ANY kind of follow up until I demanded that a credit be issued immediately (she thought $100 would be sufficient - whatever!) Had Lashey simply made some attempt to communicate with me on the day of the delivery and also make any attempt to follow up after the damage had been done, my responses would have been drastically different.We finally received the $100 credit but never ANY apology or further communication from Lashey Poree or Andreque Jones.'}, {'review_id': 'evNrTM3KyL43WlGlrBNokw', 'business_id': 'tC3J0kq_T-7ZINOJPSTWlA', 'user_id': '6GwH1q2eJSlk_O47pcf8eQ', 'date': '2012-02-22', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': \"Ehhhh............that's kind of how I feel about this place.

Order at the back from a range of different options: Chicken, rib tips, spare ribs, brisket... there's a couple different combos available, and a bunch of different sides.The bread is just sliced bread, white or wheat. There's always a variety of desserts available, though I'm not sure if they're brought in or made fresh by Jones.Unfortunately, no beef ribs (unless I'm missing something?). I love the sauce--you can get it hot, medium, or mild. No beer, which disappointed my business partner on a recent visit to Seattle, but that's what the CC Ale House, Lotties, or the Bourbon Bar up the street is for. ;)So if you're on a Light Rail adventure headed south, pop off at the Columbia City exit and walk 2-3 blocks east on Edmunds to Rainier.

To me as long as the meat is tender and the seasoning is right I am not going to complain. That being said I think Jones is a solid 3 stars. The ribs were nice and tender, with a slightly spicy sauce that tasted like what I consider to be the taste of BBQ sauce. The chicken had a nice rub and was moist and equally as tender as the ribs. The Columbia city store also has Mac and Cheese which I was told goes fast. Once I tasted it I was in heaven! Nice and cheesy with a nice crust. I was lucky enough to snag a corner piece which is my favorite because it has the creamy consistency that everyone loves about Mac and Cheese and the crunchy bits that come with the eating the corner piece.

One could go so far as to say that there are times when we find ourselves jonesing for good BBQ. Unfortunately, Jones BBQ does not satisfy the urge. We have visited this location three or four times, hoping each time that Jones would live up to its reputation, but each time it has failed us for one reason or another. Every time we\\'ve gone to Jones (weekday afternoons, weekday evenings, weekends) they have been out of multiple key items: ribs (all the time), mac and cheese, coleslaw, white meat chicken, etc. The gaps almost always come in threes. They\\'ll offer to substitute rib tips for ribs, but that\\'s like paying for steak and getting a burger.(Note: For those of you who don\\'t know, rib tips are what\\'s left when ribs are trimmed to be uniform in size. Tips are often meaty and tender but almost always have a thick band of cartilage running through them, rendering a small chunk of the \"tip\" inedible.)If you happen to get what you are jonesing for, the quality is sometimes hit but often miss. On a recent trip, we ordered the rib/chicken combo only to be told that they were -- you guessed it! -- out of ribs, so here come the rib tips. Rather than being tender and moist, they were dry and stringy, almost like jerky. Jones liberally poured on the sauce to mask the dryness to no avail. The chicken was tasty on the outside but raw in the middle.Brighter notes: The fried okra was cooked just right. The crinkly fries were served hot and crispy, and the sweet tea is almost always spot on.If you want good BBQ in Columbia City and you want to have better odds of getting what you want how you want it, head over to Willie\\'s BBQ (about 3/4 of a mile north on Rainier Ave by the old Chubby and Tubby).'}, {'review_id': 'JVqVp7Oze9RJ5IGBZUYSwg', 'business_id': 'tC3J0kq_T-7ZINOJPSTWlA', 'user_id': 'AjBWVjeMOmvfd-iZCgAtJw', 'date': '2011-03-13', 'stars': 5.0, 'text': 'It seems that everyone you talk to has a different take on what good BBQ is, but most will agree that the Seattle area is sorely lacking in BBQ of any type.Jones BBQ, in my opinion, is the best of the limited options that you will find anywhere around Seattle. The beef brisket sandwich is my favorite item especially with a hot link added on for good measure. The sauce is the key here as even the medium is on the spicy side and has a real good, smoky flavor.The sides are decent to great from the cole slaw and mac and cheese to the corn bread and baked beans. They also feature some great dessert options like sweet potato pie and peach cobbler which are both really good. I would also recommend the chocolate cake although it was a bit rich for me.I have never had a problem with the service during any of my trips here. The atmosphere is definitely that of a locally owned small business and you are treated like a welcome and appreciated guest.My quest for good, local BBQ restaurants is not over by any means, but any place I do try will have to measure up to these guys and that will not be an easy task.'}, {'review_id': 'U_CSqQhnzgXvVYGR5mkTqg', 'business_id': 'tC3J0kq_T-7ZINOJPSTWlA', 'user_id': 'R0jLEd0Fa82D6xU3q5SZOg', 'date': '2011-04-22', 'stars': 2.0, 'text': 'The PNW, in general, is not known for quality BBQ folks. &#160;You can check out my list of reviews and find the ONE exception that I\\'ve discovered (so far). &#160;Jones is close to my work location. &#160;There are days when I dont want to drive into downtown to grab a quick bite to eat, so I\\'ll walk around SoDo instead.Jones is a no-frills cafeteria-style BBQ joint. &#160;The menu is pretty standard, and the lunch specials are popular. &#160;If you are looking for award-winning, \"its so good I\\'d smack my grandma for more\" meat...you wont find it here.Jones, like many BBQ imitators, is obsessed with slathering as much ketchup-based sauce onto their meat as they can. &#160;As a result, most of what you taste is their (overly red pepper-flaked) sauce.PROS: Close to the major SoDo employers, lunch specials are easy on the walletCONS: I dont know if they will ever be able to scrub the grease out of their floors, pretty run-of-the mill wannabe BBQ*** Note: I accidentally submitted this update for the wrong location - I dined at the SODO location ***'}, {'review_id': 'xAW3KfYO4xcAv-hJfuJV7A', 'business_id': 'tC3J0kq_T-7ZINOJPSTWlA', 'user_id': 'ifrL9DZ30ibOWX5KfXxFDA', 'date': '2007-07-29', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"Delicious RIBS! &#160;Tender pork, lots of meat around the bones RIBS! &#160;Also recommend the candy yam pie and the Banana Cream Cheesecake. &#160;I must say I've never had Banana Cheesecake with so much Banana flavor, small chunky bits of bananas YUM!! &#160;You MUST try this item. &#160;They also have Peach Cobbler but they ran out that night :(This place has quite a bit of charter and tucked away on a side street in the transitioning neighborhood in Columbia City....boy has this area changed!!\"}, {'review_id': 'xX8qcShkrZz5grd7enuwQA', 'business_id': 'tC3J0kq_T-7ZINOJPSTWlA', 'user_id': 'ZXUknjmznjaC46izTmWqhA', 'date': '2009-05-24', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': 'Jones certainly has a leg up in the Seattle BBQ market.

Peanut flavor really shined through in this dish. The soup was significantly more cloudy that most other Thai places that I've been to, resulting in a thicker soup - not quite a broth. Also, I found it to have a tad too much lemongrass in it, but if that's your thing you will enjoy. Good sized servings, good food but nothing to go bananas over. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful - at times they came over to see what I needed when I was simply pointing at a friend. Water was always full and a 12-person group's checks were split up without us having to ask. I would come back again. I did find prices to be on the high side however - usually $2-3 more than most places. Soup was $10, as was the pad thai. Bottom line: If I were in fremont I'd eat here again without hesitation. &#160;Prices higher than most, but ambiance makes up for it.\"}, {'review_id': 'EYPsz7xrdlbOYdSENzTA2g', 'business_id': '5FSwUssGpGH1kXr9uhEdLQ', 'user_id': 'GZnZwAKDgDMlMHBMXzbSfQ', 'date': '2013-02-04', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"Jai Thai is my favorite of all the Thai restaurants in Fremont.

He was taking awhile, so one of my friends walked it up to him to explain how we divided things up. Our friend came back and told us, \"Apparently tip isn\\'t included and we still need to pay tip.\" I\\'m thinking, \"What the heck? First of all, what waiter reminds you to pay tip? Kind of tacky. Second of all, the bill said 20% gratuity automatically included for parties of six or more and they charged us already.\" So we waited for the waiter to come back with our receipts to sign and he, yet again, reiterated, \"Remember, the tip was not included, so you still need to include the tip. The tip was not included.\" Okay, we heard you the first time. So I look at the bill again and I was right. It was already included. What a shady old man. It\\'s a red flag if he has to actually TELL you, the customer, to remember to tip him. How can he forget that he already charged us the tip? The bill said so!I was so livid so I confronted him and said, \"Excuse me, why would you say we owe you tip? You already charged us the tip.\" Then he replied, \"Oh my mistake. You are right.\" Yeah.

Mostly because each of my favorite Thai dishes comes from a different restaurant. In my search to discover the next best Thai dish last week, my friend Selina and I revisited Jai Thai in Fremont. What I like about Jai Thai is that it\\'s one of the few restaurants in Seattle that stays open till midnight. This may not seem like a big deal to the average New Yorker, but here in Seattle, if you get off work past 10pm, you would be hard pressed to find a decent restaurant without having to take a road trip across town. With an authentic Thai friend on board who grew up with a family owned Thai restaurant, we were sure to land on something spectacular.Selina suggested the Phad See Ew, which literally translates to \"Fried with Soy Sauce.\" I generally hesitate to order this noodle dish because I feel the noodles can be overcooked and bland, none of which was the case here. When it arrived, our eyes lit up and we knew this one would be a hit. Without even tasting it, the chicken looked tenderly marinated in a black sweet soy sauce, the broad rice noodles were thick and firm, the large pieces of chinese broccoli looked like they had just been chopped down, while the egg appeared to hold everything together. After the first bite, I knew it would be hard to ever find a Phad See Ew that matched the love and care put into this one. The Chinese broccoli, known as Kai-lan in chinese, opened my world to a delightful new leaf vegetable. So crispy, fibrous and delicious, the Chinese broccoli was the highlight of the dish. To complement the crunchy vegetable, the wide rice noodles had been saturated in a satiating Thai sauce. Almost certainly, the eggs had acted like a glue, helping to retain the flavors along the walls of the noodles, which filed my mouth with every bite. A healthy serving of chicken had sponged up the sauce and added another dimension to the vegetables and noodles. If you\\'re in the mood for a crisp noodle dish, I highly recommend getting the Phad See Ew at Jai Thai.'}, {'review_id': 'rRLnyjPLhHUK2fYac44ZTA', 'business_id': '5FSwUssGpGH1kXr9uhEdLQ', 'user_id': 'InG33zwJT6SD8_Hp5R6GJg', 'date': '2011-11-29', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"Jai Thai absolutely has some hidden gems and is a delight to patronize.

However, I'm not really one to cook too often, so I'm often looking for healthy places to eat out. Somewhere in the midst of this, I fell in love with Thai food.

Not so expensive as to keep you away probably, but expect to spend about 15 to 20 bucks a plate. I point this out because, at least for me, one of the charms of Thai food is that it's generally inexpensive and yummy.So... Why do I love Jai Thai?At the front of the restaurant, they have these little knee high Thai style tables, complete with sitting cushions. they're positioned conveniently next to large, open windows that look out on the main intersection of Fremont.The fun part for me is that you're actually part of the street, because it's unusual enough for people to be lounging so close to the window, that people tend to notice you as they're walking by.And that's fun, trading smiles with strangers passing by.Jai Thai is a very comfortable place to lounge with friends, relax and people watch, while eating good Thai food, and drinking Thai beer.\"}, {'review_id': 'aL50iVmdFYbTLjGOFo29qQ', 'business_id': '5FSwUssGpGH1kXr9uhEdLQ', 'user_id': 'afWO9kq0i3OSAwuQyZmIjg', 'date': '2006-09-06', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': 'Better of the locations for food taste.

A good 7 -10 minutes later she returned, took our order of Tom Kha soup and Drunken Noodles (I had been anticipating those the whole day after reading all your Yelp reviews) and a glass of chardonnay. In the hurriedness of the taking of our order, my friend and I forgot to specify &#160;a star rating concerning spicyness, but since no star option was given, the idea didn\\'t hit us till after she left. I wasn\\'t too worried about it all taking so long since I expected the same delays most of the reviewers warned me about.  &#160; &#160;The noodles came out shortly after the soup and wine (both were great...the soup was nicely coconutty with a little kick), the portion not dissapointing to neither Emily nor myself. But, alas! The Drunken Noodle hype I had built up for myself proved to be a waste of energy. Kicking myself for not reminding the server about offering spicy star levels, I chewed patiently through the dish, exchanging hopeful glances at my friend anticipating some flavor to hit us. All I could taste was oily pan flavor, but since the prawns and veggies were so generously distributed throughout the dish, I found elements about it to enjoy. Emily and I laughed and chatted away as we shared the plate, which is how two friends should do it.The still-flustered-looking server came back with our bill and was still quietly sweet, dispite her looking tired and stressed. It made me wonder if Jai Thai has that akwardly too-busy-right-now feeling on a regular basis. At least the server never stopped trying to smile (something I need to work on regarding my own service!).Is it normal not to be asked about the spicness preference of your meal? Mention it, if you can, if any of you write a new review.2 stars. A plus for the Stranger being available to read at my table while we waited, but a minus for only the small bit of candlelight by which to read it. A plus for the fantastic soup and mellow wine, but a minus for the uber-blah Drunken Noodles (possibly named after the state one would have to be in to enjoy them). A plus for the server\\'s sympathetic hospitality, but also a minus for its sporadicity. A plus for the meal being under $22, but a minus for me being too much of a pig to save any for Leftover Reviews (my fault entirely!). And where were the happy hour menus, or drink menus?

While most other Thai restaurants try to foist off regular old runny red curry as penang, Jai Thai Fremont\\'s penang is true to it\\'s country of origin; thick and coconutty with a hint of peanut taste and a small swirl of coconut milk known as \"gati\" on top. It\\'s wonderful. I lived and worked in Thailand for numerous years, speak the language well and lament the fact that out of the literally hundreds of Thai restaurants in the western Washington area there are only a very few like: Noodle Nation in the U. District, Thai Curry Simple in Chinatown/International District (but only on Saturday morning Thai local day), Viengtong off MLK and the Noodle Boat in Issaquah that serve really authentic Thai food. HINT: If they have to ask you how many \\'stars\" you want or don\\'t bring you a tablespoon (chorn gin kaaw) or a tiny bowl of chilis in fish sauce when you order rice dishes, chances are almost certain it ain\\'t gonna be authentic; but I digress. The atmosphere in Jai Thai is pretty cool and fits in well with the hip neighborhood which is Fremont. The service is hit and miss but is usually satisfactory unlike most thai joints. Besides the penang, other dishes on the menu can be pretty good too. The Kanom Jiin with green curry is a northern Thai favorite and done pretty well at Jai Thai. If you order green curry (gang keeow waan) in Bangkok it will come with rice, as most Bangkokians consider kanom jiin (a type of white noodles) a food only eaten by the peasants (bahn nawk) despite it being delicious with curry. The pad thai, pad siew and pad kee mao are just as mundane here as at most other Thai restaurants however. Overall, Jai Thai Fremont is not bad for a Thai restaurant in the US and I will go back again but as I said before, it\\'s the penang that really makes this place stand out from the others.'}, {'review_id': 'dhw2uzCMsT8YUpiBcaW_fw', 'business_id': '5FSwUssGpGH1kXr9uhEdLQ', 'user_id': 'KQ_gl2MqmlMM-qyeDtOWMA', 'date': '2008-08-20', 'stars': 2.0, 'text': \"Jai Thai gets four stars for their food and minus 2 stars for their service. &#160;My friend and I headed in for lunch around 2:30 on a saturday afternoon. &#160;I requested a table outside on the patio but the host told us it would be a minute. &#160;I didn't really understand why because I could see three tables open. &#160;We waited for about ten minutes before being seated and then waited another ten minutes for menus. &#160;When we got our menus I noticed that their dinner menu starts at three and everyone knows that dinner menus are pretty much just more expensive versions of the same thing. &#160;So i figure they were just trying to make us wait until three so they could get more money out of us. &#160;That's really annoying. &#160;The waitress quickly took our order but our food probably took another half an hour to come out. &#160;Our dishes were really good, we both had curries and the portions were plentiful for $10 each. &#160;I would try Jai Thai again because there's always the chance that the staff was just having an off day but I won't go when I'm in a hurry to get a quick meal.\"}, {'review_id': 'BFvNrnZS2OsCf3r6YBloAQ', 'business_id': '5FSwUssGpGH1kXr9uhEdLQ', 'user_id': 'lGr2oAdfDMFEgo7MWbE6rw', 'date': '2010-02-20', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': 'the gal pal and i eat here the other day pretty good..there stars are not very hot as fyi. so if you normally get 3 go for 4. service was good and so was the food.'}, {'review_id': 'Syj5MPoNUjqUB2Eic6TuUA', 'business_id': '5FSwUssGpGH1kXr9uhEdLQ', 'user_id': 'QgPGXQqSwxhEAY5zUq3aCg', 'date': '2006-04-05', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': 'they have a full bar, but otherwise they have just average thai food. &#160;and its really noisy in there to boot'}, {'review_id': 'qbh6E-FREe1h1dzV9LNJzA', 'business_id': '5FSwUssGpGH1kXr9uhEdLQ', 'user_id': 'M76u0eqU31rL-jwappi5JA', 'date': '2009-01-04', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': 'i like their food.'}, {'review_id': 'tX6FF9iBk8xvVJKs-EnwWg', 'business_id': '5FSwUssGpGH1kXr9uhEdLQ', 'user_id': 'Tpr-vdI7X8KxT5ar5PBEXw', 'date': '2010-04-05', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': \"I like the atmosphere of this place.

Thai iced tea is good too. I like that when you ask for 3 stars here, you get a full 3 stars.

This place wasn't out of this world, but good enough to come back again. We ordered the Panang Curry with Brown Rice and a Singha beers. The Panang curry dish was good and flavorful. I would come here again.\"}, {'review_id': 'UVjiFdtqpkvUkBeNjHXLoQ', 'business_id': '5FSwUssGpGH1kXr9uhEdLQ', 'user_id': 'mNAqezE7iZ5vjSRajQoGog', 'date': '2009-10-12', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': \"Oh, Jai Thai, how often I come to you for take out food while intoxicated. &#160;It always tastes good at the time then I feel like shit later. &#160;The phad Thai is pretty greasy as are most of the noodle dishes but the drunken noodles are good. &#160;I like the green curry too. &#160;I just think it's overpriced compared to other Thai places. &#160;Also, the service can be snappy at times. &#160;But I will still go here time after time because there are no other places in Fremont open till midnight with non bar food.\"}, {'review_id': 'Wk3KSFnQQKYIBB92KYnMaw', 'business_id': '5FSwUssGpGH1kXr9uhEdLQ', 'user_id': 'k6GurG0wmHVyiZGzmxs8eQ', 'date': '2010-04-04', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"I think Jai Thai deserves more than 3 solid Yelp stars.

The food was adequate. They've recently discontinued that discount, but I abandoned frequent visits long ago due to having the poorest service of the 5 Thai restaurants in Fremont. I was tired of hunting down the wait staff in the kitchen to get my bill paid during lunchtime, dinnertime, or during late-night happy hour. For the second time last Fall, between the terrible service and finding a hair in my soup (!!!), I stated I hoped never to darken their doorstep again...even though that Country-Style Pad Thai isn't half-bad.

Okay...I am absolutely stoked they have a gluten-free menu. However, I realized yesterday when I was there (and it was cold in the restaurant again so I took away my 5 star rating) that people who order from the gluten-free menu get penalized. So if you order from the regular menu (the yellow one) then your meal comes with a small cup of soup to start your meal, rice, phad thai, spring roll, and your entree for a very reasonable price. This is what I had the first time I was at Krua and was really excited to have all that food. Then when I realized through a Yelp review they had a gluten-free menu (the white one) I went back and ordered from that one. I ordered my gluten-free curry the last two Sundays and it didn\\'t come with rice. I said to the man, does this come with rice and he said \"no.\" Okay, well I\\'d like some rice. Then I was charged $1.25 for a small bowl of rice, which doesn\\'t make sense to me that if you are offering free rice, phad thai, soup and spring roll to customers who don\\'t require gluten-free food but are going to charge me extra for actually having less food then that\\'s messed up!!! I also ordered the mango sticky rice, which for $6.50 and the amount I got was a rip. Will I be back, probably. Will I be ordering from the gluten-free menu (which has fewer options than the regular menu)...no. I will just order from the regular yellow menu and request no spring roll, which worked the first time. More food, less money = happy customer. Also, to not have any specials on the gluten-free menu is just weird. Gluten-free individuals like combo meals, too. Bring on the free rice and phad thai but keep the spring roll to yourself!!!! Oh, and please turn on the heat!!!!!!!!!!

We decided to split the Rama Noodles ($8.25) with chicken at 1 star and pineapple curry ($8.50) with beef at 2 stars, thinking both should still be edible for anyone, and then waited for 10 minutes or so for our order. When we went to eat, we encountered an unpleasant surprise.The curry... now, I like hot food. I order Vindaloo at Indian restaurants. I like a sparing amount of habanero with my Mexican food. I\\'ve met the man. I have been accused of having no taste buds. 2 stars, described as \"medium\" on the menu, was at least as hot as Vindaloo is normally if not more so. The amount my companion tried was painful for her, and for me it was slightly uncomfortable but edible; however, the pepper level absolutely overpowered any other flavors. I\\'m thinking 5 stars might require signing a medical release form and providing contact information for the next of kin.The Swimming Rama was passable - the noodles were a bit heavy and the peanut sauce was unremarkable, so at least we didn\\'t have to go scrounge for something else.The molten curry might have been due to freak sunspot activity, but there are far too many good and consistent Thai restaurants in the Seattle area (Chantanee, for example) for me to bother with a second chance.'}, {'review_id': 'C2Ykn2jePaMmL16-F9PpYg', 'business_id': 'fT5JYF8yP34VJszUGnZ-Ug', 'user_id': 'OGKZIZ77alYOKYM6elUZgg', 'date': '2008-11-03', 'stars': 5.0, 'text': \"5 stars soley on the sa-tay tofu! &#160;The peanut sauce is soooo damn good. &#160;I usually detest Tofu, this is the only time I enjoy eating it. &#160;Mind you, it's completely COATED with the peanut sauce. &#160;Kinda like tofu fondue.Mmmm, had it last night and writing that paragraph made me wish that I had ordered 2 portions so I had some for b-fast.The main courses have not wowed me like the sa-tay, but the have always been decent.We love this place for delivery on a movie night.It has been my experience that they are a little weak on the star system- if you usually like 2 stars, maybe go for 3.\"}, {'review_id': 'Zf1PZ589NYF_10pkMlVVnA', 'business_id': 'fT5JYF8yP34VJszUGnZ-Ug', 'user_id': 'PO5SaOYog19v3Mzed6I5IA', 'date': '2007-12-18', 'stars': 5.0, 'text': \"I just found out about this place from a friend of a friend who apparently knows his stuff.

I've had it a million times at other restaurants, but here it's something special. It is so amazingly tender and juicy and delicious--imagine if chicken were a fruit (that tasted like chicken), and you put it on a stick. But you also coated it in a nice little yellow curry flavor (just a little) with some coconut milk and had it with a damn fine peanut sauce. I have no idea how they make chicken do this. I wish I knew. This stuff is so amazing it makes me question the committed relationship I have going on with pork.Everything else also blows my mind.Oh, the first time I went I think the heat was broken because it was like 20 degrees in there.

We fell in love with Krua Thai since the first time we tried it. Fish sour broth (thick orange curry with water crest omelette and shrimps) really hook us and is the dish we must order every time. For the menu... Hmm... Where should I start? It's too hard to describe all the dishes we like in detailed like my normal food review on my treo keyboard during the flight. But i'd say there's no dish we tried that's disappointing. Beside that orange curry, the top ones are clay pot prawn, pork skewer, and trout salad. I guarantee with my thai tongue that all these are authentic. Quality of their raw materials including seafood, vegetables, and duck is also second to none.They have about seven to ten tables inside and about three tables of outdoor seatings so the back lot can accommodate everyone's parking. We've been there on random nights in the week including saturday and have never experienced any wait for the table. Two waiters are staffed at all time but they also handle to-go orders which can peak some nights so the service may be a little slow. After all, they're all efficient, attentive, polite (and sometimes hot :P).Full marks for food, service, price, and parking. Oh... Did I tell you that the place and food are incredibly clean for the price range? I would cut half the star for not selling any alcohol but it's a no biggie.We eat at this place so often that you are likely to run into us when you're there.
